We'll begin with GeForce RTXand then cover robotics. Let's get started. Welcome to our world. Where every play, every moment, and every detail matters. From creating new worlds, to epic solo adventures and chaotic multiplayer showdowns, we take you beyond the edge. And by uniting fearless innovation with the power of AI, you’re charged with superpowers, making every move momentous, and bringing every concept to life. RTX, it’s on. NVIDIA has led PC gaming and content creationthrough three decades of technology breakthroughs and performance gains of 10 million X. There are now over 200 million gamersand creators worldwide who count on GeForcepowered desktops and laptops. Today, NVIDIA is at the centerof the latest technology transformation: Generative AI. Gen AI presents an opportunityfar larger than the Internet. It will change how we interact with games. It will speed up creative workflowsand will give everyone a co-pilot to make us all more productive. NVIDIA’s journey in AI began in 2006. We launched the GeForce 8800 GTX. Designed to play the most challenging video games, it proved it could certainly run Crysis. The 8800 architecture alsointroduced CUDA cores, allowing researchers and developers everywhere to program the GPU for non-graphical applications. In 2012, a team of researchersfrom the University of Toronto made an incredible discovery. The GeForce GTX 580 GPU, best known for running games like Call of Duty,could be programmed with CUDA to run a convolutional neural network,an early innovation in deep learning. In fact, the GTX 580 crushedthe record in the famed ImageNet Image Recognition contest, and the era of GPU-acceleratedDeep Learning had begun. NVIDIA launched RTX in 2018and set in motion a giant leap in graphics—real time ray tracing. Ten years in the making! It combined RT cores used to process rays,with tensor cores, used for AI-powered Deep LearningSuper Sampling, or DLSS. The ray-traced Star WarsReflections experience, which previously required four NVIDIA V100data center GPUs at a price tag of $60,000, was now possibleon a single GeForce RTX GPU. We continued to invest in ray tracing and AI. From its launch in 2018, RTX AI performance has increased 10X to 1300 Tera-ops, or TOPs. Now with DLSS 3.5, seven out of every eight pixels aregenerated by AI, accelerating full ray tracing by up to 4Xwith better image quality. Last year, AI made a dramatic leapto the mainstream. ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion inspiredan unprecedented investment in training and inference of new generative AI models. With a 100 million shipped,RTX GPUs provide a massive installed base for AI applications. In October, NVIDIA released our TensorRT LLM library for Windows, accelerating large language modelslike Llama 2 and Mistral up to 5X on RTX PCs. With our new Chat with RTX playground, enthusiasts can connect an RTX-acceleratedLLM to documents or YouTube videos using retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, and chat away. We are also introducing TensorRTacceleration for Stable Diffusion XL and SDXL Turbo in the popularAutomatic1111 app, providing up to 60% boost in performance. Looking forward,AI experiences will be delivered with a hybrid of cloudand PC computation. Hybrid AI will use NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud to run the largest language models, while taking advantage ofRTX tensor cores on your PC to run latency-sensitive applications. We are already seeing hybrid AI in action. For video conferencing, Microsoft Teams offers Copilot,an assistant running in the cloud, while NVIDIA Broadcast runs locally for noise removal and virtual backgrounds. For content creation, Adobe Photoshop includesFirefly-powered Generative Fill running in the cloud, while RTX GPUspower AI tools on the PC. And in gaming, a combination of AI in the cloud and PCwill pull you deeper into the story. Last year, we introduced ACE, our platformfor AI-powered game characters. Let me turn it over to Sethfor more detail. Thanks, Jeff. NVIDIA ACE is a technology platformthat brings digital avatars to life with generative AI. ACE AI models are designed to run in the cloud or locally on the PC. Let's walk through an interactionwith a game character. First, we start with the player's voice input. That prompt is then passed to our automatic speech recognition model,which translates speech to text. Then we feed that text into a large language modelto generate the character's response. After that, the text response is vocalizedusing a text-to-speech model which is then passed to an animation modelto create a realistic lip sync. Finally, the dynamic character is renderedinto the game scene. Here at CES, we are announcingACE Production Microservices for Audio2Face and Automatic Speech Recognition. Available now, each model can be incorporated by our developers individually into their own pipelines. We are working with top digital avatardevelopers to bring NVIDIA ACE technology to gamers. Our latest collaboration is with Convai, a developer platform that enables easy integration of GenAI-powered game characters. Convai’s platform features a set of tools and APIs to create character personas and enable dynamic conversations leveraging the new NVIDIA Audio2faceand Riva microservices. The latest features from Convai enable real-time character-to-character interaction, scene perception, and actions. Let's take a look. In this demo, we're back in the ramen shop with Jin. Except this time we're joined by Nova,a cybersecurity expert in our cyberpunk-flavored world. Let’s listen in as these two AI game characters have a generated conversation. [JIN]Nova, you ever get that uncanny feeling we’re like those AI constructsfrom the old sci-fi flicks? But nah, we’re too quirky for that. [SETH, off-screen]The cool thing is the conversationis different every time. [NOVA]Quirky is one word for it, Jin. I think we're just too real to be anythingbut flesh and blood. You're not wrong, Jin. Sometimes I wonder if we're all just partof some elaborate cybernetic dream. If we were AI’s, I'd be the onecracking jokes about the singularity over a bowl of ramen. Kai. Long time no see. You've been hiding in the shadows. Or have you just been trying to avoid me? [SETH]Hey, Nova, it's good to see you. I haven't been trying to avoid you.Just been super busy. How are things? [NOVA]Things are fantastic. Just secured a juicy contractwith Zenith & Sons. [SETH]Hey Jin, you hear that? Nova just landed a big contract. Let's break out the good stuff. [JIN]Ah, you got it, Kai. Nova’s success calls for the top shelfcelebration. Just don't expect this to become a habit. [SETH]Thanks, Jin. So, Nova, have you been playing any games recently? [NOVA] I've been testing this cool game techon a secret new GPU that's launching very soon. I can't talk about it here,but I can show you at the lab. [SETH]Wow, that sounds super cool. Yeah, I'd love to see the game tech. Let's go back to your lab. [NOVA]Absolutely. Follow me and prepare to be blown awayby what you're about to see. With Convai’s latest framework, game characters can now interact with the scene by fetching objects and navigating the world, all based on your conversation. Over to you, Kristina. Thank you, Seth.

NVIDIA and our partners are excitedfor what comes next! And now we will hear from Deepu Tallaabout a new era for robotics. Thanks, Jeff. I would like to share how the infusionof generative AI into robotics is speeding up the ability to bring robotsfrom proof-of-concept to real-world deployment. For the past few years, autonomous robotspowered by artificial intelligence are being increasingly utilizedfor improving efficiency, decreasing costs and tackling labor shortages. Logistics, warehouses, and manufacturing are the first use casesthat had the biggest need. And today, we can seehundreds of thousands of deployed robots, with each of them getting smarteras time goes on due to AI updates. Large-scale fulfillment centersand manufacturing plants that are millions of square feet in area continue to add more smart robots. The next wave of industries for AI-powered smart robotsinclude agriculture, construction, healthcare, and retail. In the last 12 months, generative AI has revolutionized text andnatural language processing. The introduction of ChatGPT has beennoted as the iPhone moment of AI. Very soon we are at the tipping pointof the same technology coming to computer vision and robotics. Generative AI models achieve higher accuracywhile generalizing rather well and applications are builtusing natural language prompts or text. Given these attributes, generativeAI is well-suited for robotics. Now let's see how NVIDIA is bringingthe massive potential of generative AI to robotics. Our platform for building AI-poweredrobots is called NVIDIA Isaac. To deploy AI, there are two computers necessary. The AI factory is where the simulation and training of the AI model happens. It is essentiallythe creation of the model. This process can go on throughoutthe operating life of the robot. The AI model can be continuously improvedso that it gets better and better, more accurate, more performant,and more generalizable. Some applications might demand the AI model to be fine-tuned round-the-clock,365-days-a-year. For example,if you are operating a fleet of autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs,that are marching towards the goal of full autonomy. On the other end of the spectrum, the AI model only needs to beupdated occasionally, and as a result, re-training happensperiodically. For example, a robotic vacuum cleanerthat needs to adapt to your home floor plan. The AI Factory leverages NVIDIA’s data centercompute infrastructure, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Now let's switch to the second computer,which is the run-time of the robot. The computer can be an on-premise server. For example, performing defect inspectionfor a high-speed semiconductor manufacturing line. Or the computer can be an autonomous machine processor,such as an NVIDIA Jetson, powering an AMR or industrialARM with multiple sensors such as 4 to 8 cameras,multiple 2D lidars, 3D lidar, and IMU. Over the past year,we have seen how generative AI-powered chatbots and copilotscan improve our productivity. Applying generativeAI to robotics will be transformative to accelerating the developmentand deployment of smarter robots. If we think back to our two-computermodel, let's see how generative AI, when combined with NVIDIA Omniverserunning in the AI factory, enhances simulation. We are seeing that LLMs caneliminate bottlenecks and turn typical usersinto technical artists. Whether it's creating an individualrobotic work cell or a full-scale manufacturing facility, simulation teamsmake a significant investment to build the right 3D digital twin to test and train their virtual robots. Leveraging the ability to reason andgenerate code with an LLM like ChatGPT the desired scene can be createdfrom a text prompt in minutes. Under the hood,all of the available assets can be utilized and placed in the scenein meaningful ways. Robots often operate indynamic environments, so even after the scene is created,new 3D assets will need to be generated. Starting with NVIDIA's Picasso, a text-to-3Dasset generative AI model, new realistic assets can be generated from a text prompt and placed in the scene. When testing or training a robot, diversity in environments is essential to ensure the robot can generalizeto the real world. Starting with text prompts,generative AI can add rain, water, rust,and more to existing environments and create thousandsof physically accurate scenarios. Tasks that typically take a technical artist days can be completed in minutes. It doesn't end there. Generative AI can act as your copilot when it comes to writing scripts. Simply enter the prompt and generatethe necessary code to run robot simulations or generatesynthetic data that is auto-labeled, saving enormous amounts of expense and time. All of this capability is available or coming soon with NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac Sim. Make sure you leverage itif you're not already doing so. We showed you how Generative AI is supercharging robot simulationand synthetic data generation in the AI factory. Now let's see how generative AI can turbocharge the run-timecapabilities of robots. LLMs and LVMs are making it possible for humans to interact with robotsusing natural language. A generative AI model trained withvideo, text, and other modalities is able to generalize well andachieve higher accuracy than multiple purpose-built CNN-based computer vision models. Let's see how some of our partners are driving the generative AI revolution for their robotic operations. Thank you for tuning in and enjoy CES 2024. How many calculations do you think your graphics card performs every second while running video games with incredibly realistic graphics? Maybe 100 million? Well, 100 million calculations a second is what’s required to run Mario 64 from 1996. We need more power. Maybe 100 billion calculations a second? Well, then you would have a computer that could run Minecraft back in 2011. In order to run the most realistic video games such as Cyberpunk 2077 you need a graphics card that can perform around 36 trillion calculations a second. This is an unimaginably large number, so let’s take a second to try to conceptualize it. Imagine doing a long multiplication problem once every second. Now let’s say everyone on the planet does a similar type of calculation but with different numbers. To reach the equivalent computational power of this graphics card and its 36 trillion calculations a second we would need about 4,400 Earths filled with people, all working together and completing one calculation each every second. It’s rather mind boggling to think that a device can manage all these calculations, so in this video we’ll see how graphics cards work in two parts. First, we’ll open up this graphics card and explore the different components inside, as well as the physical design and architecture of the GPU or graphics processing unit. Second, we’ll explore the computational architecture and see how GPUs process mountains of data, and why they’re ideal for running video game graphics, Bitcoin mining, neural networks and AI.So, stick around and let’s jump right in. This video is sponsored by Micron which manufactures the graphics memory inside this graphics card.Before we dive into all the parts of the GPU, let’s first understand the differences between GPUs and CPUs. Inside this graphics card, the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU has over 10,000 cores. However, when we look at the CPU or Central Processing Unit that’s mounted to the motherboard, we find an integrated circuit or chip with only 24 cores. So, which one is more powerful? 10 thousand is a lot more than 24, so you would think the GPU is more powerful, however, it’s more complicated than that. A useful analogy is to think of a GPU as a massive cargo ship and a CPU as a jumbo jet airplane. The amount of cargo capacity is the amount of calculations and data that can be processed, and the speed of the ship or airplane is the rate at which how quickly those calculations and data are being processed. Essentially, it’s a trade-off between a massive number of calculations that are executed at a slower rate versus a few calculations that can be performed at a much faster rate.Another key difference is that airplanes are a lot more flexible since they can carry passengers, packages, or containers and can take off and land at any one of tens of thousands of airports. Likewise CPUs are flexible in that they can run a variety of programs and instructions. However, giant cargo ships carry only containers with bulk contents inside and are limited to traveling between ports. Similarly, GPUs are a lot less flexible than CPUs and can only run simple instructions like basic arithmetic. Additionally GPUs can’t run operating systems or interface with input devices or networks. This analogy isn’t perfect, but it helps to answer the question of “which is faster, a CPU or a GPU?�. Essentially if you want to perform a set of calculations across mountains of data, then a GPU will be faster at completing the task. However, if you have a lot less data that needs to be evaluated quickly than a CPU will be faster. Furthermore, if you need to run an operating system or support network connections and a wide range of different applications and hardware, then you’ll want a CPU. We’re planning a separate video on CPU architecture, so make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss it, but let’s now dive into this graphics card and see how it works. In the center of this graphics card is the printed circuit board or PCB, with all the various components mounted on it, [Animator Note: Highlight and list out the various parts that will be covered.] and we’ll start by exploring the brains which is the graphics processing unit or GPU. When we open it up, we find a large chip or die named GA102 built from 28.3 billion transistors. The majority of the area of the chip is taken up by the processing cores which have a hierarchical organization. Specifically, the chip is divided into 7 Graphics Processing Clusters or GPCs, and within each processing cluster are 12 streaming multiprocessors or SMs. Next, inside each of these streaming multiprocessors are 4 warps and 1 ray tracing core, and then, inside each warp are 32 Cuda or shading cores and 1 tensor core. Across the entire GPU are 10752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor Cores, and 84 Ray Tracing Cores. These three types of cores execute all the calculations of the GPU, and each has a different function. CUDA cores can be thought of as simple binary calculators with an addition button, a multiply button and a few others, and are used the most when running video games. Tensor cores are matrix multiplication and addition calculators and are used for geometric transformations and working with neural networks and AI. And ray tracing cores are the largest but the fewest and are used to execute ray tracing algorithms. Now that we understand the computational resources inside this chip, one rather interesting fact is that the 3080, 3090, 3080 ti, and 3090 ti graphics cards all use the same GA102 chip design for their GPU. This might be counterintuitive because they have different prices and were released in different years, but it’s true. So, why is this? Well, during the manufacturing process sometimes patterning errors, dust particles, or other manufacturing issues cause damage and create defective areas of the circuit. Instead of throwing out the entire chip because of a small defect, engineers find the defective region and permanently isolate and deactivate the nearby circuitry. By having a GPU with a highly repetitive design, a small defect in one core only damages that particular streaming multiprocessor circuit and doesn’t affect the other areas of the chip. As a result, these chips are tested and categorized or binned according to the number of defects. The 3090ti graphics cards have flawless GA102 chips with all 10752 CUDA cores working properly, the 3090 has 10,496 cores working, the 3080ti has 10,240 and the 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores working, which is equivalent to having 16 damaged and deactivated streaming multiprocessors. Additionally, different graphics cards differ by their maximum clock speed and the quantity and generation of graphics memory that supports the GPU, which we’ll explore in a little bit. Because we’ve been focusing on the physical architecture of this GA102 GPU chip, let’s zoom into one of these CUDA cores and see what it looks like. Inside this simple calculator is a layout of approximately 410 thousand transistors. This section of 50 thousand transistors performs the operation of A times B plus C which is called fused multiply and add or FMA and is the most common operation performed by graphics cards. Half of the CUDA cores execute FMA using 32-bit floating-point numbers, which is essentially scientific notation, and the other half of the cores use either 32-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers. Other sections of this core accommodate negative numbers and perform other simple functions like bit-shifting and bit masking as well as collecting and queueing the incoming instructions and operands, and then accumulating and outputting the results. As a result, this single core is just a simple calculator with a limited number of functions. This calculator completes one multiply and one add operation each clock cycle and therefore with this 3090 graphics cards and its 10496 cores and 1.7 gigahertz clock, we get 35.6 trillion calculations a second. However, if you’re wondering how the GPU handles more complicated operations like division, square root, and trigonometric functions, well, these calculator operations are performed by the special function units which are far fewer as only 4 of them can be found in each streaming multiprocessor. Now that we have an understanding of what’s inside a single core, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other sections of the GA102 chip. Around the edge we find 12 graphics memory controllers, the NVLink Controllers and the PCIe interface. On the bottom is a 6-megabyte Level 2 SRAM Memory Cache, and here’s the Gigathread Engine which manages all the graphics processing clusters and streaming multiprocessors inside. Now that we’ve explored this GA102 GPU’s physical architecture, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other parts inside the graphics card. On this side are the various ports for the displays to be plugged into, on the other side is the incoming 12 Volt power connector, and then here are the PCIe pins that plug into the motherboard. On the PCB, the majority of the smaller components constitute the voltage regulator module which takes the incoming 12 volts and converts it to one point one volts and supplies hundreds of watts of power to the GPU. Because all this power heats up the GPU, most of the weight of the graphics card is in the form of a heat sink with 4 heat pipes that carry heat from the GPU and memory chips to the radiator fins where fans then help to remove the heat. Perhaps some of the most important components, aside from the GPU, are the 24 gigabytes of graphics memory chips which are technically called GDDR6X SDRAM and were manufactured by Micron which is the sponsor of this video. Whenever you start up a video game or wait for a loading screen, the time it takes to load is mostly spent moving all the 3D models of a particular scene or environment from the solid-state drive into these graphics memory chips. As mentioned earlier, the GPU has a small amount of data storage in its 6-megabyte shared Level 2 cache which can hold the equivalent of about this much of the video game’s environment. Therefore in order to render a video game, different chunks of scene are continuously being transferred between the graphics memory and the GPU. Because the cores are constantly performing tens of trillions of calculations a second, GPUs are data hungry machines and need to be continuously fed terabytes upon terabytes of data, and thus these graphics memory chips are designed kind of like multiple cranes loading a cargo ship at the same time. Specifically, these 24 chips transfer a combined 384 bits at a time, which is called the bus width and the total data that can be transferred, or the bandwidth is about 1.15 terabytes a second. In contrast the sticks of DRAM that support the CPU only have a 64-bit bus width and a maximum bandwidth closer to 64 gigabytes a second. One rather interesting thing is that you may think that computers only work using binary ones and zeros. However, in order to increase data transfer rates, GDDR6X and the latest graphics memory, GDDR7 send and receive data across the bus wires using multiple voltage levels beyond just 0 and 1. For example, GDDR7 uses 3 different encoding schemes to combine binary bits into ternary digits or PAM-3 symbols with voltages of 0, 1, and negative 1. Here’s the encoding scheme on how 3 binary bits are encoded into 2 ternary digits and this scheme is combined with an 11 bit to 7 ternary digit encoding scheme resulting in sending 276 binary bits using only 176 ternary digits. The previous generation, GDDR6X, which is the memory in this 3090 graphics card, used a different encoding scheme, called PAM-4, to send 2 bits of data using 4 different voltage levels, however, engineers and the graphics memory industry agreed to switch to PAM-3 for future generations of graphics chips in order to reduce encoder complexity, improve the signal to noise ratio, and improve power efficiency. Micron delivers consistent innovation to push the boundaries on how much data can be transferred every second and to design cutting edge memory chips. Another advancement by Micron is the development of HBM, or the high bandwidth memory, that surrounds AI chips. HBM is built from stacks of DRAM memory chips and uses TSVs or through silicon vias, to connect this stack into a single chip, essentially forming a cube of AI memory. For the latest generation of high bandwidth memory, which is HBM3E, a single cube can have up to 24 to 36 gigabytes of memory, thus yielding 192 gigabytes of high-speed memory around the AI chip. Next time you buy an AI accelerator system, make sure it uses Micron’s HBM3E which uses 30% less power than the competitive products. However, unless you’re building an AI data center, you’re likely not in the market to buy one of these systems which cost between 25 to 40 thousand dollars and are on backorder for a few years. If you’re curious about high bandwidth memory, or Micron’s next generation of graphics memory take a look at one of these links in the description. Alternatively, if designing the next generation of memory chips interests you, Micron is always looking for talented scientists and engineers to help innovate on cutting edge chips and you can find out more about working for Micron using this link. Now that we’ve explored many of the physical components inside this graphics card and GPU, let’s next explore the computational architecture and see how applications like video game graphics and bitcoin mining run what’s called “embarrassingly� parallel operations. Although it may sound like a silly name, embarrassingly parallel is actually a technical classification of computer problems where little or no effort is needed to divide the problem into parallel tasks, and video game rendering and bitcoin mining easily fall into this category. Essentially, GPUs solve embarrassingly parallel problems using a principle called SIMD, which stands for single instruction multiple data where the same instructions or steps are repeated across thousands to millions of different numbers. Let’s see an example of how SIMD or single instruction multiple data is used to create this 3D video game environment. As you may know already, this cowboy hat on the table is composed of approximately 28 thousand triangles built by connecting together around 14,000 vertices, each with X, Y, and Z coordinates. These vertex coordinates are built using a coordinate system called model space with the origin of 0,0,0 being at the center of the hat.To build a 3D world we place hundreds of objects, each with their own model space into the world environment and, in order for the camera to be able to tell where each object is relative to other objects, we have to convert or transform all the vertices from each separate model space into the shared world coordinate system or world space. So, as an example, how do we convert the 14 thousand vertices of the cowboy hat from model space into world space? Well, we use a single instruction which adds the position of the origin of the hat in world space to the corresponding X,Y, and Z coordinate of a single vertex in model space. Next we copy this instruction to multiple data, which is all the remaining X,Y, and Z coordinates of the other thousands of vertices that are used to build the hat. Next, we do the same for the table and the rest of the hundreds of other objects in the scene, each time using the same instructions but with the different objects’ coordinates in world space, and each objects’ thousands of vertices in model space. As a result, all the vertices and triangles of all the objects are converted to a common world space coordinate system and the camera can now determine which objects are in front and which are behind. This example illustrates the power of SIMD or single instruction multiple data and how a single instruction is applied to 5,629 different objects with a total of 8.3 million vertices within the scene resulting in 25 million addition calculations. The key to SIMD and embarrassingly parallel programs is that every one of these millions of calculations has no dependency on any other calculation, and thus all these calculations can be distributed to the thousands of cores of the GPU and completed in parallel with one another. It's important to note that vertex transformation from model space to world space is just one of the first steps of a rather complicated video game graphics rendering pipeline and we have a separate video that delves deeper into each of these other steps. Also, we skipped over the transformations for the rotation and scale of each object, but factoring in these values is a similar process that requires additional SIMD calculations. Now that we have a simple understanding of SIMD, let’s discuss how this computational architecture matches up with the physical architecture. Essentially, each instruction is completed by a thread and this thread is matched to a single CUDA core. Threads are bundled into groups of 32 called warps, and the same sequence of instructions is issued to all the threads in a warp. Next warps are grouped into thread blocks which are handled by the streaming multiprocessor. And then finally thread blocks are grouped into grids, which are computed across the overall GPU. All these computations are managed or scheduled by the Gigathread Engine, which efficiently maps thread blocks to the available streaming multiprocessors. One important distinction is that within SIMD architecture, all 32 threads in a warp follow the same instructions and are in lockstep with each other, kind of like a phalanx of soldiers moving together. This lock step execution applied to GPUs up until around 2016. However, newer GPUs follow a SIMT architecture or single instruction multiple threads. The difference between SIMD and SIMT is that while both send the same set of instructions to each thread, with SIMT, the individual threads don’t need to be in lockstep with each other and can progress at different rates. In technical jargon, each thread is given its own program counter. Additionally, with SIMT all the threads within a streaming multiprocessor use a shared 128 kilobyte L1 cache and thus data that’s output by one thread can be subsequently used by a separate thread. This improvement from SIMD to SIMT allows for more flexibility when encountering warp divergence via data-dependent conditional branching and easier reconvergence for the threads to reach the barrier synchronization. Essentially newer architectures of GPUs are more flexible and efficient especially when encountering branches in code. One additional note is that although you may think that the term warp is derived from warp drives, it actually comes from weaving and specifically the Jacquard Loom. This loom from 1804 used programmable punch cards to select specific threads out of a set to weave together intricate patterns. As fascinating as looms are, let’s move on. The final topics we’ll explore are bitcoin mining, tensor cores and neural networks.

So now that we’ve explored how single instruction multiple threads is used in video games, let’s briefly discuss why GPUs were initially used for mining bitcoin. We’re not going to get too far into the algorithm behind the blockchain and will save it for a separate episode, but essentially, to create a block on the blockchain, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is run on a set of data that includes transactions, a time stamp, additional data, and a random number called a nonce. After feeding these values through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm a random 256-bit value is output. You can kind of think of this algorithm as a lottery ticket generator where you can’t pick the lottery number, but based on the input data, the SHA-256 algorithm generates a random lottery ticket number. Therefore, if you change the nonce value and keep the rest of the transaction data the same, you’ll generate a new random lottery ticket number. The winner of this bitcoin mining lottery is the first randomly generated lottery number to have the first 80 bits all zeroes, while the rest of the 176 values don’t matter and once a winning bitcoin lottery ticket is found, the reward is 3 bitcoin and the lottery resets with a new set of transactions and input values. So, why were graphics cards used? Well, GPUs ran thousands of iterations of the SHA-256 algorithm with the same transactions, timestamp, other data, but, with different nonce values. As a result, a graphics card like this one could generate around 95 million SHA-256 hashes or 95 million randomly numbered lottery tickets every second, and hopefully one of those lottery numbers would have the first 80 digits as all zeros. However, nowadays computers filled with ASICs or application specific integrated circuits perform 250 trillion hashes a second or the equivalent of 2600 graphics cards, thereby making graphics cards look like a spoon when mining bitcoin next to an excavator that is an asic mining computer. Let’s next discuss the design of the tensor cores. It’ll take multiple full-length videos to cover generative AI, and neural networks, so we’ll focus on the exact matrix math that tensor cores solve. Essentially, tensor cores take three matrices and multiply the first two, add in the third and then output the result. Let’s look at one value of the output. This value is equal to the sum of values of the first row of the first matrix multiplied by the values from the first column of the second matrix, and then the corresponding value of the third matrix is added in. Because all the values of the 3 input matrices are ready at the same time, the tensor cores complete all of the matrix multiplication and addition calculations concurrently. Neural Networks and generative AI require trillions to quadrillions of matrix multiplication and addition operations and typically uses much larger matrices. Finally, there are Ray Tracing Cores which we explored in a separate video that’s already been released. That’s pretty much it for graphics cards.

Thanks for watching to the end! hello I'm James a digital human your hemoglobin A1c was at a healthy level [Music] supercomputers are among Humanity's most vital instruments driving scientific breakthroughs and expanding the frontiers of knowledge at Nvidia our journey has been Pro profoundly shaped by our work on supercomputers in 2006 we announced Cuda and launched the world's first GPU for scientific Computing Japan's Tokyo Tech subam in 2008 was the world's first Nvidia accelerated supercomputer 4 years later Nvidia powered the world's fastest supercomputer the oakd National Labs Titan then in 2016 Nvidia introduced the first AI supercomputer djx1 which I hand delivered to open AI from the world's first GPU for supercomputers to now building AI supercomputers for the world our journey in supercomputing over the past 18 years has shaped the Nvidia of today since cud is inception Nvidia has driven down the cost of computing by a millionfold for some Nvidia is a computational

have shown predictable improvements in AI model performance as they scale with model size data and computing power the industry's current trajectory scales computing power four-fold annually projecting a millionfold increase over a decade for comparison Mo's law achieved 100 fold increase per decade these scaling laws apply not only to llm training but with the Advent of open AI strawberry also to inference over the next decade we will accelerate our road map to keep Pace with training and inference scaling demands and to discover the next plateaus of intelligence this is Blackwell today's AI computers are unlike anything built before every stage of AI Computing from data processing to training to inference challenges every component from gpus to memory to networking

laid the groundwork for today's accelerated Computing proving the power of gpus for large scale simulations from everyone at Nvidia congratulations Professor caufman on this well-deserved recognition your pioneering contributions exemplify the spirit of progress that drives the field forward as a result of this groundbreaking work accelerated Computing has become the technology of choice for supercomputing this chart shows the history of accelerated and unaccelerated supercomputers among the top 100 fastest systems in the world in The Last 5 Years the number of accelerated systems has increased by 8 systems per year and increased from 33% to over 70% of the top 100 our goal is to help the world accelerate every workload it is certainly ambitious given the wide range of programming languages breath of developer experience and needs and ongoing emerging algorithms and techniques to support our developer community and meet them where they are today we offer over 450 libraries many which are tailored to specific domains an Ever evolving developer landscape take python for example warp is our pythonic framework for building and accelerating data generation and spatial Computing most physics based simulators in HBC engage in some form of spatial Computing whether it in quantum chemistry climate modeling or fluid dynamics all of which operate in 3D space and by expressing these calculations and warp they can be automatically differentiated and integrated into AI workflows one of the most most popular python libraries that exist today is numpy numpy is the foundation library for mathematical Computing for python developers it's used by over 5 million scientific and Industrial developers with 300 million downloads just last month over 32,000 GitHub applications use numpy in important science domains like astronomy physics signal processing and many others however as scientists look to scale their applications to use large HPC clusters they often need to use lower level distributed computing libraries like open MPI but what if you didn't what if your numpy program could just automatically paralyze across a GPU cluster without having to rewrite the Python program into a different supercomputing application today we're announcing Cai numeric a dropin replacement for the numpy library with cpai numeric researchers can write in Python and easily scale their work without needing expert in distributed computing Cai numeric automatically distributes the data across a GPU cluster using standard numpy data types powered by nvidia's latest communication and math libraries the results are incredible the research team at slack is using coupon numeric to analyze terabytes of data from the lcls x-ray laser which fires 120 shots per second during a 60-hour beam time they achieved a 6X speed up in data analysis allowing to make realtime decisions and uncover material properties this acceleration has reduced their analysis time before publication from 3 years to only 6 months early adopters for cpai numeric include Stanford University Center for turbulence research working on computational fluid Dynamic solvers Los Almos National Laboratory scaling ml algorithms for the Vado supercomputer and the University of Massachusetts Boston studying the entripy production rate in a microscopy Imaging experiment one of the highest honors at supercomputing is the Gordon Bell prize recognizing exceptional achievements in high performance Computing today we celebrate five finalist teams whose groundbreaking research leverages nvidia's accelerated systems across diverse Fields including molecular Dynamics protein design genomics and climate modeling JPI Barka and his team from the University of canaba and Melbourne University scaled an alternative method for calculating Atomic energies achieving a 3X speed up over other GPU accelerated methods and a super linear scaling on multiple gpus later we'll hear from Dr David keys at coust about their pioneering work on genomic epistasis and climate emulation but first let's turn to Dr Arvin ramanathan from argon National Laboratory to discuss their advancements in protein design one of the key tasks in protein design is to come up with novel proteins that have the same function but are different from what we have seen from over the course of 4 billion years of evolution experimental data happens to come at much slower Paces than what you would expect from a computational workflow like a simulation protein design is quite a happening area in AI right now it's undergoing this huge revolution in terms of how AI models are being deployed and developed this is one of the the first attempts at building something that's IM multimodal we actually have the descriptions that are provided in natural language and then you have the protein sequences that are represented and we basically use that to train a large language model that will enable us to interact with and get new designs and one of the key things that we also learned from this paper was the fact that yes it is possible for us to stand up this workflow not on just one platform but across several different platforms at the same time we happen to use almost all of nvidia's architecture from 00s all the way to Grace Hopper chips but one of the cool things that we observed was in terms of pre-training this model we could really achieve nearly three xof flops in mixed Precision runs on the system again this sort of runs at the scale of I think half of the system was what we actually used to achieve that sort of performance is really [Music] unbelievable one of the key benefits and motivations for accelerating workloads is to reduce energy consumption nowhere is this more understood than in supercomputing where the end of Mo's law was first predicted supercomputing centers like oish National Labs as far back as 2010 recognized that the energy for NextGen supercomputers built with CPUs will consume even more power than a major US city this truth also applies to Applications themselves even though an accelerated server May consume more power than a standard CPU system the significant reduction in time to solution results in a huge reduction in the total energy needed to compute a solution for example Texas Advanced Computing Center and Anis achieved a 110x speed up and 6X better Energy Efficiency on a 2.5 billion cell problem using Grace Hopper at enal h100 gpus improved Energy Efficiency by 4X for a wind farm simulation tsmc reduced energy use by 9x using kitho for Semiconductor manufacturing the University of Tokyo's earthquake Research Institute in partnership with jamstack and riken also achieved an 86x speed up and 32 times better Energy Efficiency for earthquake simulations using the Euro HBC Alp system we are continuously pushing for higher performance and efficiency in AI as well large language models like llama 3.1 405b require multiple gpus working together for Optimal Performance to fully utilize these gpus our inference software stack provides optimized parallelism techniques relying on Fast data transfers between gpus nvidia's EnV switch technology equips Hopper with Superior GPU to GPU throughput and when integrated with our trt llm software stack deliver continuous performance improvements this insures Hopper achieves higher performance and lower cost per token for models like 405b in just two months we've seen over a 1.6x Improvement in performance thanks to Innovations in speculative execution mvlink communication and specialized AI kernels and we're not stopping with hopper we're actively innovating to harness the power of Blackwell to build Next Generation AI factories we're excited to collaborate and support customer successes within our growing solution ecosystem our partners offer a wide range of systems from Hopper to Blackwell the h200 mvl is specifically designed for air cooled flexible HPC Solutions featuring a 4 GPU mvlink domain in a standard pcie form factor we're also working with Partners to bring Grace Blackwell configurations to Market these include the gb200 grace Blackwell nvl 4 super chip which integrates a 4 GPU EnV link domain with a dual grce CPU for liquid cooled scientific Computing the roll out of Blackwell Solutions is progressing smoothly thanks to our reference architecture enabling Partners to quickly bring products to Market while adding their own customizations our goal is to accelerate every workload to drive Discovery and maximize Energy Efficiency this includes both accelerated and partially accelerated applications that can take advantage of tightly coupled CPU and GPU products like Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell however not everything takes advantage of acceleration just yet for this long tail using the most energy efficient CPU in a power constrained data center environment maximizes workload through put the grace CPU is purpose-built for high performance and Energy Efficiency Grace features 72 arm neoverse V2 cores and the Nvidia scale coherency fabric which delivers 3.2 tab a second of bandwidth double that of a traditional CPU paired with lpddr 5x memory it can achieve 500 GB a second of memory bandwidth while consuming just 16 Watts that's 1/5 the power of conventional DDR memory these Innovations enable Grace to deliver up to 4X the performance for workloads like weather forecasting and geoscience when compared to x86 systems making an ideal solution for energy efficient high performance CPU Computing earlier this year at computex Jensen unveiled our next Generation Arm based CPU Vera set to debut in 2026 it will be available both as a standalone product and as a tightly integrated solution with the reuin GPU with a focus on data movement our next Generation CPU Fabric and nvlink chipto Chip Technologies are designed to maximize system performance ver will be a versatile CPU capable of delivering performance and efficiency across a wide range of compute and memory intensive tasks and it's not just about single node Computing networking plays a critical role in today's accelerated Computing platforms traditional ethernet was designed for Enterprise data centers optimized for single server workloads nvidia's Envy link combined with infin band or Spectrum X ethernet sets the gold stand standard for AI training and inference data centers this combination enables extreme scalability and Peak Performance nvlink switch systems allow gpus to scale up and communicate seamlessly as a unified ho for East West compute Fabrics where fast data exchange between gpus is critical Nvidia Quantum infiniband and Spectrum X ethernet provide the low latency High throughput infrastructure needed to scale Beyond mvlink domains for North South traffic Bluefield dpus optimize data flow between the data center and the external networks ensuring both efficiency and security together these Technologies create a powerful and resilient infrastructure for large scale Ai and HPC workloads Nvidia Quantum infiniband delivers unmatched high-speed data transfer with minimal latency essential for parallel processing and distributed computing the quantum x800 platform features a 144 Port switch with 800 gbits per Port powered by the connect X8 supernick together they support MPI and nickel offloads enabling 14.4 Tera flops of in network computing with Nvidia sharp without sharp all reduced operations require repeated point-to-point transfers sharp can optimize this by performing data reductions directly within the network switches reducing data transfer and boosting efficiency this results in a 1.8x more effective bandwidth for AI applications Microsoft Azure a longtime user of infiniband for scientific simulations will be among the first to adopt the advanced Quantum x800 for developing cuttingedge trillion parameter models many customers want to use ethernet instead of infiniband to simplify their operations however standard ethernet was not built to meet the demands of ai ai factories alternate between GPU compute periods and Collective operation data transfers Network delays introduced can cause tail latencies which slows the overall workload performance this histogram comparison shows how Spectrum X reduces tail latency compared to traditional ethernet in multi-tenant deployments Spectrum x with noise isolation eliminates Network hotspots and can deliver 2.2x better all reduced performance by dynamically rebalancing to avoid failed links Spectrum X increases point-to-point bandwidth by 1.3x this results in Superior performance and reliability for the largest AI data center deployments last month X announced the world's largest accelerated system the Colossus supercomputer this system is built by Dell and super micro featuring 100,000 h100 gpus to train grock 3 one of the world's most advanced large language models we've worked dilig ently ly with our partners to deploy Colossus in record time going from equipment delivery to training in just 19 days and full scale production within 122 days thus far X has been thrilled with the system performance Spectrum X ethernet is achieving an impressive 95% of theoretical data throughput compared to 60% with traditional ethernet Solutions the system also maintains zero latency degradation and no packet loss due to flow collisions across the the three tiers of the network fabric this deployment sets a new standard for AI at scale we are extremely excited to announce that Spectrum X is making its debut on the top 500 list in fact two Spectrum X powered systems find themselves in the top 50 both are Dell based one built by GMO internet group and the other by our very own Nvidia isra1 supercomputer I'm sure these will be the first of many to come we build our platform on a one-year Cadence continually advancing each component to redefine performance and efficiency but it's not just about the hardware continuous software optimization is key with every cycle we enhance our software stack to extract more from our gpus CPUs and dpus this means users can consistently leverage Cutting Edge advancements without disruption leading to compounding improvements today Blackwell is in full production next year Blackwell Ultra raise the bar even higher followed by Reuben ensuring that each generation builds on the last to deliver even greater breakthroughs in Ai and HPC over the past year we've witnessed an explosion of new Aid driven use cases data sets and foundational models a standout example is evolutionary scales work in accelerating drug Discovery with the release of the esm3 generative model for protein design built on the Nvidia accelerated Computing platform platform esm3 was trained on over 2 billion protein sequences using 60 times more data and 25 times more computing power than its predecessor esm2 now let's hear from Dr David keys of cou to tell us about their two Gordon Bell finalist submissions for genomics and climate modeling genomewide Association studies explore the great dogma of biology that genotype leads to phenotype genotype here includes not only genomic factors but also environmental factors like demographics diet smoking habits and so forth and the goal is to start with a large database of individuals we used the 305,000 person UK biobank and uh then compare their genomes and their generalized genotypes to one another and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject we actually were able by means of scaling up to go from the 3 5,000 patients for which we have real data to a synthetic database generated from 13 million patients and that number is actually enough for more than half the countries of the world to do a full genomic analysis of their populations we had very little difficulty moving the code from one to another so in particular we ran on the v100s of summit we ran on the A1 100s of Leonardo and we ran on the hopper 100s the GH configuration of Alps node for node Hopper is by far the most interesting in terms of performance and also because it offers the fp8 and we're happy to use it as close to the low Precision end as we can get away with and would encourage other domain scientists to try to take advantage of that this is a very exciting prospect uh because many future venues of smart health and smart agriculture will benefit greatly from a democratized genomewide Association studies there is a 45 institution campaign in its sixth generation of generating future climates called seip and they are starting to become handicapped by the volume of data that they produce and each of these institutions is devoting hundreds of millions of core hours to generating these future climates climate emulation is a statistical model that tries to reproduce the statistics of the chaotic simulations we actually brought the queriable distance down to about 3 and 1/2 km from maybe 100 km on earlier models we were able to obtain 8 exif flops of mixed Precision on the Alps system and that was on 2,000 of those nodes I think a digital twin is reproducing the statistics of the real world by making the full 2D surface of the Earth visible at very high resolution with data compression uh with Statistics that reproduce ensembles of pte based models we feel that we've democratized climate [Music] emulation it is incredible to see all the great work being done by researchers to harness the power of AI for science while training AI models is important the real value relies in deploying these models and using them in inference where they can generate insights and predictions in real time to make it easier for users to scale AI models in production we've introduced Nvidia Nim inference microservices we've collaborated with the model Builders worldwide to convert their models into high performance efficient runtimes as Nims these Nims deliver two to five times faster token throughput than standard AI runtimes offering the best total cost of ownership weather and climate affect a wide range of Industries Transportation energy agriculture insurance and many more the frequency of extreme weather events costing over a billion dollars is increasing at an alarming rate since 1980 the financial impact of severe storm events in the US has increased 25 fold the importance of timely and accurate weather modeling data is at an all-time high the weather company uses Nvidia gpus for kilometer scale simulations of their graph model achieving 10 times higher throughput and 15 times greater Energy Efficiency compared to traditional CPU based simulations to drive even greater speed and efficiency they're also working with the video to adopt AI based methods

AI model for kilometer scale super resolution earlier this year we showed its ability to Super resolve typhoons over Taiwan today Earth 2 Nim for cordi is now available cordi is 500 times faster and 10,000 times more energy efficient than traditional highresolution numerical weather prediction using CPUs we've also worked with us weather forecasting agencies to develop a ctive model for the entire continental US an area 300 times larger than the original Taiwan based model however not every use case requires high resolution forecasts some applications can benefit from more larger ensembles at corser resolutions state-of-the-art numerical models like the GFS are limited to 20 ensembles due to computational constraints today we're also announcing the availability of forecast net Nim it can deliver Global two-e forecasts 5,000 times faster than numerical weather models this makes it possible to use ensembles with thousands of members opening new opportunities for climate Tech

virtual screening and Drug Discovery and we're excited to see what our ecosystem of researchers does with it next AI has transformed the study of proteins for drug Discovery and we think AI has the potential to make the same impact in digital chemistry with an estimated 10 to the 60th possible materials in the universe and only 10 to the eth currently known there's huge potential to innovate announcing Nvidia Alchemy it's a collection of chemistry specific Nims for the discovery of new compounds scientists start by defining the properties they want like strength conductivity low toxicity or even color a generative model suggests thousands to millions of potential candidates with the desired properties then the Alchemy Nim can sort the candidate compounds for stability by solving for their lowest energy states using Nvidia warp resulting in 100 times faster design space search going from months to a day using the Alchemy workflow the best candidates are identified before moving forward to costly real world testing traditional engineering analysis workflows from physics simulation to visualization can take weeks or even months to complete most analysis of physical systems like planes and Automobiles and ships use a set of loosely coupled applications each generating information which must be interpreted by engineers at each step a real-time digital twin enables an engineer to adjust design parameters for example you could change the shape of a body panel and see how it impacts streamlines in real time announcing Omniverse blueprint for realtime digital twins the blueprint is a reference workflow that includes nvidia's acceleration libraries physics AI Frameworks and Omniverse to design simulate and visualize all in real time it can run on all Cloud platforms as well as nvidia's own djx cloud Al Cadence seens and others are exploring how to integrate the blueprint into their own services and products for design acceleration Nvidia is also collaborating with fre scale to incorporate the blueprint into their physics AI platform let's take a look at the blueprint in action everything manufactured is first simulated with Advanced physics and solvers computational fluid dynamic simulations or cfd can take hours or months limiting the number of possible design Explorations with an Nvidia Omniverse blueprint for realtime physics digital twins software makers can integrate Nvidia acceleration libraries physics ML and RTX visualization into their existing tools enabling a 1200X speed up in design iteration time here luminary Cloud

Cuda X accelerated cfd solver the model understands the complex relationship between airflow fields and varying car geometries generating results orders of magnitude times faster than with the solver alone the AI output is visualized in real time using Omniverse apis now an engineer can make geometry or scene modifications seeing the effects in real time and because of omniverses data interoperability the engineer can even bring new new geometries and the simulation will adapt instantly what took weeks or even months is now a matter of seconds software developers everywhere can now bring unprecedented speed and flexibility to the world's industrial designers and Engineers helping save massive cost and shorten the time to Market ansus is adopting nvidia's Technologies into its CA platform Anis fluent accelerated by Nvidia gpus Insight powered by Omniverse visualization and Sim AI built on Nvidia Nim microservices AI will not only transform simulation it will accelerate scientific experimentation as well an overwhelming amount of data is being generated by Advanced instruments such as radio telescopes particle accelerators x-ray light sources and fusion reactor experiments for example the square kilometer array is expected to be completed by the end of the decade the ska in Australia will produce an average of 1 terabyte a second a thousand times more than the current state-of-the-art array in particle physics the lhcb detector at CERN produces 5 terabytes of data per second following the 2030 upgrade it could reach as high as 25 terabytes per second both the instruments and the researchers time are incredibly valuable making essential to extract meaningful insights from all of this data as efficiently as possible we are working with the researchers at the SEI Institute and breakthrough listen to deploy the world's first AI search for fast radio bursts or F frbs while over 1,000 have been detected only 15 have been traced to specific galaxies we've implemented a realtime pipeline using Nvidia Hollow scan at the Allen telescope array processing data from 28 dishes at 100 gbits per second this pipeline can process 100 times more data than conventional methods used today this is the first direct feed of raw telescope data to an AI model for f frb detection Quantum Hardware offers the opportunity to revolutionize Computing in fundamental ways unfortunately today's best quantum processors can only perform hundreds of operations before their fundamental unit of computation their cubits just become overwhelmed wood noise this makes scaling Quantum Hardware into useful Computing devices impractical today we're announcing a partnership with Google to apply nvidia's state-of-the-art AI supercomputing to solve this Challenge and accelerate their Quantum Hardware development to be useful quantum computers need large numbers of cubits operating with performance far beyond today's capabilities AI supercomputing is the key to building higher quality error corrected cubits that can meet these demands Google Quantum AI is working with Nvidia to explore how to accelerate digital representations of their superconducting cubits unlike circuit simulations which focus on the highle operation of an ideal quantum computer dynamical simulations model the complex physics describing real noisy Quantum Hardware fully accounting for how the cubits inside the quantum processor interact not only with each other but also with their surrounding environment dynamical simulations are essential to understanding and reducing Cubit specific sources of noise using Nvidia hardware and software Google Quantum aai researchers can accelerate these complex simulations this enhances the ability of researchers to understand the noise in their systems explore new designs and increase Hardware performance all of which are essential for scaling Quantum [Music] processors and we're also announcing that dynamical simulation is available

computing 2024 [Music] Jensen this is such an honor thank you for being here I'm delighted to be here thank you in honor of your return to Stanford I decided we'd start talking about the time when you first left you joined LSI logic and that was one of the most exciting companies at the time you're building a phenomenal reputation with some of the biggest names in Tech and yet you decide to leave to become a Founder what motivated you uh uh Chris and Curtis Chris and Curtis uh uh I was an engineer at LS logic and Chris and Curtis were at Sun and I was working with with uh some of the brightest Minds in computer science at the time of all time uh including andyto shim and others uh building building workstations and Graphics workstations and so on so forth and uh Chris and Curtis uh uh said one day that they like to leave some son and they like uh me to go figure out what they're going to go leave four and and um I had a great job but they they insisted that I uh figure out you know with them how to how to build a company and so so we hung out at Denny when whenever they Dro by and and uh uh which was which is by the way my alma marter my my first company uh you know my first job before for before CEO was a was a dishwasher and so and and I did that very well and and so anyways uh we got together and and we we DEC and it was during the the microprocessor Revolution this is 1993 and and 1992 when we were getting together the PC Revolution was just getting going you you know that Windows 95 obviously which is the Revolutionary version of Windows uh didn't even come to the market yet and Pentium wasn't even announced yet and so and this is this is all before the right before the PC Revolution and it was it was pretty clear that that uh the microprocessor was going to be very important and we we thought you know why don't we build a company uh to go solve problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose Computing can't and and so that that became the company's Mission uh to go to go build a computer uh the type of computers and solve problems that normal computers can't and to this day uh we're focusing on that and if you look at all the the problems that that um and the markets that we opened up as a result uh it's you know things like uh computational drug design um uh weather simulation materials design these are all things that we're really really proud of uh robotics uh self-driving cars uh autonomous autonomous uh software we call artificial intelligence and then all you know of course uh we uh we drove the the uh U the techn techology so hard that that eventually the computational cost uh uh went to approximately zero and then enabled enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself artificial intelligence as we know it today and so so I that was that was it that was the journey yeah thank you all for [Laughter] coming well these applications are on all of our minds today but back then the CEO of LSI logic convinced his biggest investor Don Valentine to meet with you he is obviously the founder of seoa yeah now I can see a lot of Founders here edging forward in anticipation but how did you convince the most sought-after investor in Silicon Valley to invest in a team of firsttime Founders building a new product for a market that doesn't even exist I I didn't know how to write a business plan and and uh uh so I went to a went to a book bookstore and back then there were bookstores and and and um in the business book section there was this book and it was written by somebody I knew Gordon Bell and this book I should go find it again but it's a very large book and the book says how to write a business plan and and that was you know a highly specific title for a very niche market and it seems like he wrote it for like you know 14 people and I was one of them and and so I I bought the book I I should have known right away that that it was a bad idea because that you know Gordon is super super smart and super smart people have a lot to say and and they wanted you know and I I'm pretty sure Gordon wants to teach me how to write a business plan uh completely and so I I picked up this book it's like 450 pages long well I never got through it not even close I I flipped through it a few pages and I go you know what by the time I'm done reading this this thing I'll be out of business I'll be out of money and and uh Lori and I only had about 6 months uh in the bank and we had already Spencer Madison and and uh and a dog and so the five of us had to live off of you know uh whatever money we had in the bank and and so I didn't have much time uh and so instead of writing the business plan uh I just went to talk to to W Coran he turn he called me one day and said hey you know you left the company you didn't even tell me what you were doing I want you to come back and explain it to me and so I went back and I explained it to Wi and wi wi at the end of it he he said I have no idea what you said and and um that's one of the worst elevator pitches I've ever heard um and then he picked up the phone and he called Don Valentine and he he called Don and he says Don I want you to give I'm going to send a kid over I want you to give him money he's one of the best employees l logic ever ever had and um I and and so the thing I learned is is uh uh you you can make up a great interview you could even have a bad interview but you can't run away from your past and so have a good past you know try to have a good past and and and in a lot of ways I was serious when I said I was a good dishwasher I was probably Denny's best dishwasher um I I planned my work I was organized you know I was Misan plus and then I washed The Living Daylights out of the dishes and then and then you know they promoted me to bus I was certain I'm the best bus boy Denny's ever had you know I was I never left a station with empty-handed I never came back empty-handed I was very efficient and then they and so anyways eventually I became you know a CEO I'm working I'm still working on being being a good CEO but you talk about being the bad you needed to be the best among 89 other companies that were funded after you to build the same thing and then with 6 to9 months of Runway left you realized that the initial Vision was just not going to work MH how did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you well we started uh this company called for Accelerated Computing and the question is what is it for what's the killer app and and uh that was that that came our first great decision um and this is what sequa funded the first great decision was the first killer app was going to be 3D graphics and the the the technology was going to be 3D graphics and the application was going to be video games at the Time 3D Graphics was impossible to make cheap it was Million dooll image generators from Silicon graphics and the video and so it was a million dollars and and it's hard to make cheap um and the video game Market was0 billion doar so you have this incredible technology that's hard to uh commoditize and commercialize and then you have this Market that doesn't exist that was that intersection was the founding of our company and and I still remember uh when when Don at the end of my presentation uh you know Don was still kind of he he said you know know one of the things he said to me which made a lot of sense back then makes a lot of sense today he says startups don't invest in startups or startups don't partner with startups and his point is that in order for NVIDIA to succeed we needed another startup to succeed and that other startup was Electronic Arts and and then on the way out he he reminded me that electronic arts's CTO is 14 years old and had to be driven to work by his mom and he just wanted to remind me that that's who I'm relying on that that and then and uh and then after that he said if you lose my money I'll kill you and that that was that was kind of my memories of that first meeting uh but nonetheless uh we created we created something uh we went on uh the next several years to go create the market to create the gaming market for PCs and it took a long time to do so we're still doing it today uh we realize that not only do you have to create the technology and uh invent a new way of doing computer Graphics so that what was a million dollars is now you know three 400 $500 um that fits in the computer and you have to go create this new market so we have to create technology create markets the idea that a company would create technology create markets defines Nvidia today almost everything we do we create technology we create markets that's that's the reason why people say we have a you know people call it a stack an ecosystem words like that um but that's basically it at the core for 30 years what Nvidia realized we had to do is in order to uh create the conditions by which somebody could buy our products we had to go invent this new market and uh it's the reason why we were early in autonomous driving it was the reason why we're early in deep learning it was the reason why we're early and just about all these things including uh computational drug disc drug design and and Discovery um all these different areas we're trying to create the market while we're creating the technology and so that that's um uh okay and then we got we got going and and then and then um Microsoft introduced uh a standard called direct 3D and that spawned off hundreds of companies and we found ourselves a couple years later competing with just about everybody and and the thing that that we invented the company the technology we invented uh 3D graphics with the consumerized 3D with turns out to be incompatible with direct 3D so we started this company we had this 3D Graphics thing we million-dollar thing we're trying to make it consumerized and so we invented all this technology and then shortly after it became incompatible and um uh so we had to reset the company uh or go out of business but we didn't know how to we didn't know how to build it the way that Microsoft had defined it and um and I remember I remember a meeting at at you know on a weekend and the conversation was you know we now have 89 competitors uh I understand that the way we do it is not not right but we don't know how to do it the right way and and um thankfully there was another bookstore and um and the bookstore is called fries Fries electronics I don't think I don't know if it's still here um and so I had I had I had um I I I think I drove madis and my daughter on a weekend to fries and and it was sitting right there the openg manual uh which would defined uh how silicon Graphics did computer graphics and so it was it was right there it was like $68 a book and so I had a couple hundred dollar I bought three books I took it back to the office and I said guys I found it our future and I handed out I had three versions of it handed out had a big nice centerfold you know the centerfold is the opengl pipeline which is the computer Graphics Pipeline and um uh and I handed it to uh the same Geniuses that I founded the company with and we implemented the openg pipeline like nobody had ever implemented the opengl pipeline and we built something the world never seen and so uh a lot of lessons are right there that moment in time for our company uh gave us so much confidence and the reason for that is you can succeed in doing something inventing a future even if you were not informed about it at all and is kind of the my attitude about everything now you know when somebody tells me about something and I've never heard of it before or if I've heard of it never don't understand how it works at all my first thought is always you know how hard can it be and it's probably just a textbook away you know you're probably one archive paper away from figuring this out and so I spent a lot of time reading archive papers and um and it it's true it's true you can you can um now of course you can't learn how somebody else does something and do it exactly the same way and hope to have a different outcome but you could learn how something can be done and then go back to First principles and ask yourself um giving the conditions today given my motivation given the instruments the tools um given you know how things have changed how would I redo this how would I reinvent this whole thing how would I design a how would I build a car today would I build it incrementally from 1950s and 1900s how would I build a computer today how would I write software today does that make sense and so I go back to First principles all the time uh even in the company today and just reset ourselves you know because the world has changed and U the way we wrote software in the past was monolithic and it's designed for supercomputers but now it's disaggregated it's you know so on so forth and how we think about software today how we think about computers today how we think just always cause your company always cause yourself to go back to first first principles and it creates lots and lots of opportunities yeah the way you applied this technology turns to be revolutionary you get all the momentum that you need to IPO and then some more because you grow your Revenue nine times in the next four years but in the middle of all of this success you decide to Pivot a little bit the focus of innovation happening at Nvidia based on a phone call you have with this chemistry professor can you tell us about that phone call and how you connected the dots from what you heard to where you went uh remember at the core the company was uh pioneering a new way of doing Computing computer Graphics was the first application uh but we already always knew that there would be other applications and so image processing came particle physics came fluids came so on so forth all kinds of interesting things that we wanted to do uh we made the processor more programmable so that we could express more algorithms if you will and then one day we invented um uh programable shaders which made all forms of Imaging and computer Graphics programmable that was a great breakthrough so we invented Ed that on top of that we invented uh we we tried to look for ways to express um uh more comp more sophisticated algorithms uh that could be computation that could be computed on our processor which is very different than a CPU and so we we created this thing called CG this I think it was 2003 or so C for gpus it predated Cuda by about three years um the same person who wrote The textbook that saved the company Mark Hilgard wrote that textbook and um I and so CG was was super cool we wrote textbooks about it we started teaching people how to use it we developed tools and such um and then several several researchers discovered it uh many of the researchers here students here at Stanford was using it um many of the the engineers that that then became uh engineers at Nvidia were were uh playing with it uh uh a doctor a couple of doctors at at Mass General picked it up and used it for uh CT reconstruction so I flew out and saw them and said you know what are you guys doing with this thing and uh they told me about that and then and then uh a um uh a computational a Quantum chemist uh used it to um uh Express his his algorithms and so I I realized that that there's there's some evidence that people might want to use this uh and and it gave it gave us gave us you know incrementally more more confidence that that we ought to go do this that that this field this form of computing could solve problems that normal computers really can't and and um reinforced our belief and and kept us going every time you heard something new you really savored that surprise and that seems to be a theme throughout your leadership at Nvidia U it feels like you make the these bets so far in advance of Technology inflections that when the Apple finally falls from the tree you're standing right there in your black leather jacket waiting to catch it how do you find the conv always seems like a diving catch oh it does seem like a diving catch you do things based on core beliefs you know we we uh we we deeply believe that that we uh we could create a computer that solves problems Norm processing can't do that there are limits to what a CPU can do there are limits to what general purpose Computing can do and then there are interesting problems uh that we can go solve the question the question is always are those in interesting problems only or are they can they also be interesting markets because if they're not interesting markets it's not sustainable and Nvidia went through about a decade where we were investing in this future and the markets didn't exist there was only One Market at the time was computer Graphics uh for 10 15 years the markets that fuels Nvidia today just didn't exist and so so how do you continue um uh with all of the people around you you know our company and you know nvidia's management team and all of the amazing Engineers that they're creating this future with me um all of your shareholders your board of directors all your partners you're you're taking everybody with you and there's no evidence uh of a market that is really really challenging you know the fact that the technology can solve problems and the fact that you have research papers that that are used that that are made possible because of it are interesting but you're always looking for that market but nonetheless before a market exists you still need early indicators of future success you know we we have this phrase in the company is is you know there's a phrase called key performance indicators unfortunately kpis are hard to understand I find kpis hard to understand what's a good kpi you know a lot of people you know when when we look for kpis we go gross margins that's not a kpi that's a result you know you're looking for something that's an early indicators of future positive results okay and as early as possible and the reason for that is because you want early indic that early sign that you're going in the right direction and so we have this phrase is called EO ifs FS you know early indicators e FS early indicators of future success and and um and it helps people uh uh because I was using it all the time to give the company hope that hey look we solved this problem we solved that problem we solved this problem the markets didn't exist but there were important problems and that's what the company's about to solve these problems uh we want to be sustainable and therefore the markets have to exist at some point but you you want you want to decouple the result from um uh from evidence that you're doing the right thing okay and so so so that's how you that's how you kind of solve this problem of investing into something that's very very far away um and having the the conviction uh to stay on the road is to find as early as possible the indicators that you're doing the right things and so uh start with a core belief unless something you know changes your mind you continue to believe in it and um look for early indicators of future success what are some of those early indicators that have been used by product teams at Nvidia uh all kinds um uh uh I saw I saw I saw a uh a paper uh long before I saw the paper I met some people that needed my help on on um uh on this thing called Deep learning at a time I didn't even know what deep learning Le was and um and they needed us to create a domain specific language so that um all of their algorithms could be expressed easily on our on our processors and we created this thing called cdnn and it's essentially the SQL um uh SQL is in in storage Computing this is um neuron network computing and uh we created a a language if you will domain specific language for that you know kind of like the openg GL of of uh deep learning and so we we uh they needed us to do that so that they they could express their mathematics and uh they didn't understand Cuda but they understood their deep learning and so we created this thing in the middle for them uh and the reason why we did it was because uh even though there were zero I mean this you know these researchers had no money uh and and this is kind of one of the the great skills of our company that that you're willing to do something even though the financial returns are complet completely non-existent or maybe very very far out even if you believed in it uh we we ask ourselves you know is this worthy work to do um does this Advance a field of science somewhere that matters notice this is something that I I've been talking about you know since the very beginning of time uh we ex we we find inspiration uh not from the size of a market from but from the importance of the work uh because the importance of the work is the early indicators of a future Market and nobody has to write a nobody has to do a a um a business case on it nobody has to show me a a pnl uh nobody has to show me a financial forecast the only question is is this important work and if we didn't do it uh would it happen without us now if we didn't do something and something could happen without us it gives me tremendous Joy actually and the reason for that is could you imagine the world got better you didn't have to lift a finger that's the definition of you know of of uh ultimate laziness and and and in a lot of ways in a lot of ways you want that habit and the reason for that is this uh you want the company to be lazy about doing things that other people always do can do if somebody else can do it let them do it we should go select the things that if we didn't do it the world the world would fall apart you have to convince yourself of that that if I don't do this it won't get done that is Inc and and if that work is hard and that work is impactful and important then it gives you a sense of purpose does that make sense and so our company has been selecting these projects deep learning was just one of them and the first indicator of of the success of that was this you know fuzzy cat that that Andrew an came up with and um then Alex kvki uh detected cats um you know not all the time but you know successfully enough that it was you know this might take us somewhere and then we reasoned about the structure of deep learning and you know we're computer scientists and we understand how things work and and so we we uh we convinced ourselves this could change everything and and um and anyhow that but that's an that's an example so these selections that you've made they've paid huge dividends both literally and figuratively um but you've had to steer the company through some very challenging times like when it lost 80% of its market cap amid the financial crisis cuz what Wall Street didn't believe in your bet on ML um in times like these how do you steer the company and keep the employees motivated at the task at hand uh it's this is the my reaction during that time is the same reaction I had about this week uh earlier today you asked me about this week my pulse was exactly the same this week is no different than last week or the week before that um and so the opposite of that you know when you drop it 80% um it don't get me wrong when when your share price drops 80% it's a little embarrassing okay and and um you just want to you just want to wear a t-shirt that says wasn't my fault um but even more than that you just you just don't want to you you don't want to get out of your bed you don't want to leave the house um all of that is true all of that is true um but then you go back to go back to just doing your job I woke up at the same time I prioritize my day in the same way uh I go back to what do I believe uh you got to gut check always gut check back to the court you know what do you believe uh what are the most important things uh and uh just check them off you know sometimes sometimes it's helpful to you know family loves me okay check um you know double you know right and so you just got to check it off and and you go back to your core um and then go back to work and and then every conversations go back to the core uh keep the company focused back on the core do you believe in it did something change the stock price changed but did something else change the physics change the gravity change did did all of the things that that that we assumed uh that we believed that led to our decision did any of those things change because if those things change you got to change everything but if none of those things change you change nothing you keep on going yeah yeah that's how you do it in speaking with your employees they say that you try to avoid the public in speaking with your employees they've said that your leadership including the employees I'm just kidding no le lead leaders have to be seen unfortunately that's the hard that's the hard part you know I I I was I was I was at I was I was an electrical engineering student and I was quite Young when I went to school um when I went to went to College I was I was still 16 years old and so I was I was young when I did everything and and so I was a bit of an introvert kind of you know I'm shy I don't enjoy public speaking I'm delighted to be here I'm not suggesting um but but it's it's not something that I do naturally and and um I and so so when when things are challenging um uh it's not easy to be in front of precisely the people that you care most about you know and the reason for that is because could you imagine a company meeting we just our stock prices dropped by 80% and the most important thing I have to do as the CEO is this to come and face you explain it and partly you're not sure why partly you're not sure how long uh how bad yeah you just don't know these things and and but you still got to explain it face face all these people and you know what they're thinking you know you you know some of them are probably thinking we're doomed uh some people are probably thinking you're an idiot and some people are probably thinking you know something else and so I um there are a lot of things that people are thinking and you know that they're thinking those things but you still have to get in front of them and and and deal you know do the hard work they may be thinking of those things but yet not a single person of your leadership team left during times like this and in fact unemployable that's what I keep reminding them I'm just kidding I'm surrounded by Geniuses I'm surrounded by Geniuses yeah other Geniuses un un unbelievable uh Nvidia is well known to have singularly the best management team on the planet this is the deepest technology management team the world's ever seen I'm surrounded by a whole bunch of them and they're just genius business teams marketing teams sales teams just incredible and engineering teams my research teams unbelievable yeah your employees say that your leadership style is very engaged you have 50 direct reports you encourage people across all parts of the organization to send you the top five things on their mind and you constantly remind people that no task is beneath you can you tell us why you've purposefully designed such a flat organization and how should we be thinking about our organizations that we designed in the future uh no task is is to me no task is beneath me because remember I used to be a dishwasher and I and I mean that I used to clean toilets I mean you know I cleaned a lot of toilets I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined and and some of them just can't [Laughter] unsee I don't know I I don't know what to tell you you know that's life and and so so uh uh you can't show me and you can't show me a task that is that's beneath me um now I'm not doing it I'm not doing it uh only because because of uh you know whether it's beneath me or not beneath me U if you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you and in my in my review of IT share with you how I reason through it uh I've made a contribution to you I've made I've made it possible for you to see how I reason through something and and by reasoning as you know how someone reasons through something empowers you you go oh my gosh that's how you reason through something like this it's not as complicated as it seems this is how you reason through something that's super ambiguous this is how you reason through something that's incalculable this is how you reason through something that you know seems to be very scary this is how you seem do you understand and so I show people how to reason through things all the time strategy things you know how to forecast something how to break a problem down uh and you're just you're empowering people all over the place and so that's how I see it if you send me something you want me to help review it uh I'll do my best and I'll show you how I would do it um I in the process of doing that of course I learned a lot from you is that right you gave me a seat of a lot of information I learned a lot and so I I feel rewarded by the process um it does take a lot of energy sometimes because you know you got in order to add value to somebody and they're incredibly smart as a starting point and I'm surrounded by incredibly smart people you have to at least get to their plane you know you have to get into their head space and that's really hard that's really hard um and that takes just an enormous amount of emotional and intellectual energy and so I feel exhausted after after I I work on things like that um I'm surrounded by by a lot of great people a CEO should have the most direct report rep s um uh by definition because the people that reports to the CEO requires the least amount of management it makes no sense to me that CEOs have so few people reporting to them except for one fact that I know to be true the the knowledge the information of a CEO is supposedly so so valuable so secretive you can only share with two other people or three and their information is so invaluable so incredibly secretive that they can only share with a couple more well um I don't believe in in in a culture an environment where the information that you possess is the reason why you have power I would like us all to to to contribute to the company and our position in the company should have something to do with our ability to reason through complicated things lead other people to um achieve greatness um Inspire Empower other people um support other people those are the reasons why the the management team exists in service of all of the other people that work in the company to create the conditions by which all of the all of these amazing people who volunteer to come work for you instead of all the other amazing high-tech companies around the world they elected they volunteer to work for you and so you should create the conditions by which they could do their life's work which is Mission you know you probably heard it i' I've said that you know pretty clearly and I and I believe that what my job is is very simply to create the conditions by which you could do your life's work and so how do I do that what does that condition look like well that condition should um result in great deal of empowerment you should you can only be empowered if you understand the circumstance isn't it right you have to understand the cont you have to understand the context of the situation you're in in order for you to come up with great ideas and so I have to create a circumstance where you understand the context which means you have to be informed and the best way to be informed is for there to be as little layers of information mutilation right between us and so that's the reason why it's very often that I'm reasoning through things like in an audience like this I say first of all this is the beginning facts these are the data that we have um this is how I would reason through it these are some of the assumptions these are some of the unknowns these are some of the knowns and so you reason through it and now you've created an organization that's highly empowered nvidia's 30,000 people we're the smallest large company in the world we're tiny little company but every employee is so empowered and they're making smart decisions on my behalf every single day and the reason for that is because you know they understand that they understand my condition they understand my condition I'm very transparent with people um and uh and I believe that that I can trust you with the information often times the information is hard to hear and uh the the situations are complicated uh but I trust that you can handle it you're you know a lot of people hear me say you know these you're adults here you can handle this sometimes they're not really adults they just graduated I'm just kidding I know that when I first graduated was barely an adult and um I but I was I was fortunate that I was trusted with with uh with uh important information so I want to do that I want to create the conditions for people to do that I do want to now address the topic that is on everybody's mind AI last week you said that generative Ai and accelerated Computing have hit the Tipping Point so as this technology becomes more mainstream what are the applications that you personally are most excited about well you have to go back to First principles and ask yourself what is generative AI what happened um what happened was we have a we now have the ability to have software that can understand something they they can understand why you know what is first of all we digitized everything that was you know like for example Gene sequencing you digitized genes but what does it mean that sequence of genes what does it mean we've digitized amino acids um but what does it mean uh and so we now have the ability we dig digitize words we digitize sounds uh we digitize images and videos we digitize a lot of things but what does it mean we now have the ability through um a lot of study a lot of Da data and from their patterns and relationships we We Now understand what they mean not only do we understand what they mean we we can translate between them because we learned about the meaning of these things in the same world we didn't learn about them separately so we we learned about speech and and words and and paragraphs and vocabulary in the same context and so we found correlations between them and they're all you know registered if you will registered to each other and so now we uh not only do we understand uh the modality the meaning of each modality we can understand how to translate between them and so uh for obvious things you could caption video to text that's captioning uh text to uh images M Journey uh text to text chat GPT I amazing things and so so we now we now know that uh we understand meaning and we can translate uh the translation of something is generation of information and and um uh and all of a sudden you you have to take your you take a step back and ask yourself um uh what is the implication in every single layer of everything that we do and so I'm exercising in front of you I'm reasoning in front of you uh the same thing I did a quarter uh 15 years ago when I first saw um uh alexnet some 13 14 years ago I guess um I how I reasoned through it uh what did I see how interesting what can it do very cool but then most importantly what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean to every single layer of computing because you know we're in the world of computing and so what it means is that that the way that we um process information fundamentally will be different in the future that's what Nvidia builds you know chips and system the way we write software will be fundamentally different in the future the type of software we'll be able to write write in the future will be different new applications and then ALS also the processing of those applications will be different what was historically a retrieval based model where uh in uh information was pre pre-recorded if you will almost you know we wrote the text pre-recorded and we retrieved it based on uh some recommender system algorithm in the future uh some seed of information will be will be uh the starting point we call them prompts you as you guys know and then we generate the rest of it and so the future of computing will be highly generated well let me give you an example of what's happening for example uh we're having a conversation right now very little of the information I'm trans I'm conveying to you is Retreat most of it is generated it's called intelligence and so in the future we're going to have a lot more generative our computers will will perform in that way it's going to be highly generative instead of Highly retrieval based you go back and you got to ask yourself you know now for for you know entrepreneurs you got to ask yourself uh what industries will be disrupted therefore will we think about networking the same way will we think about storage the same way will we think about would we be as abusive of internet traffic as we are today probably not notice we're having a conversation right now and and I to get in my car every every question so we don't have to be as abusive of of transformation information transporting as we used to um uh what's going to be more what's going to be less uh what kind of applications you know etc etc so you can go through the entire industrial spread and ask yourself what's going to get disrupted what's going to get be different what's going to get NED you know so on so forth and and that reasoning starts from what is happening what is generative AI Foundation Al what is happening go back to First principles with all things there was something I was going to tell you about organization you asked the question and I forgot to answer it the way you create an organization by the way someday um don't worry about how other companies or charts look you start from first principles remember what an organization is designed to do the organizations of the past where there's a king you know CE and then then you have all all these you know the Royal subjects you know the Royal Court and then eaff and then you keep working your way down eventually they're employees well the reason why it was designed that way is because they they wanted the employees to have as low information as possible because their fundamental purpose of the soldiers is to die in the field of battle to die without asking questions you guys know this I don't I only have 30,000 employees I would like them none of them to die I would like them to question everything does that make sense and so the way you organize in the past and the way you organize today is very different to Second the question is what is nid what does Nvidia build an organization is designed so that we could build what it whatever it is we build better and so if we all build different things why why are we organized the same way why would why would this organizational Machinery be exactly the same irrespective of what you build it doesn't make make any sense you build computers you organize this way you build healthare Services you build exactly the same way it makes no sense whatsoever and so you had to go back to First principles just ask yourself what kind of Machinery what what is the input what is the output what are the properties of this environment you know what what is the what is the what is the forest that this animal has to live in what is this characteristics is it stable most of the time you're trying to squeeze out the last drop of water or is it changing all the time being attacked by everybody and so you got to understand you know you're the CEO your job is to architect this company that's my first job to create the conditions by which you can do your life's work and the architecture has to be right and so you have to go back to First principles and think about those things and I was fortunate that that when I was 29 years old you know I had the benefit of of of taking a step back and asking myself you know how would I build this company for the future and what would it look like and you know what's the operating system which is called culture what do we what kind of behavior do we en encourage enhance and what what do we discourage and not enhance you know so on so forth and anyways I want to save time for audience questions but um this year's theme for view from the top is redefining tomorrow and one question we've asked all of our guests is Jensen as the co-founder and CEO of Nvidia if you were to close your eyes and magically change one thing about tomorrow what would it be were we supposed to think about this in advance I I'm going to give you a horrible answer um I I don't know that it's one thing look there are a lot of things we don't control you know there are a lot of things we don't control um your job is to make a unique contribution live a life of purpose to do something that nobody else in the world would do or can do to make a unique contribution so that in the event that after you done um everybody says you know the world was better because you were here and so I think that that to me um I live I live my life kind of like this I go forward in time and I Look Backwards so you asked me a question that's exactly from a from a computer vision pose perspective exactly the opposite of how I think I never look forward from where I am I go forward in time and look backwards and the reason for that is it's easier I would look backwards and kind of read my history we did this and we did that way and we broke that prom down does that make sense and so it's a little bit like um how you guys solve problems you figure figure out what is the end result that you're looking for and you work backwards to achieve it and so I imagine Nvidia uh making a unique contribution to advancing the the future of of uh of computing which is the single most important instrument of all Humanity now it's not about our self self-importance but this is just what we're good at and it's incredibly hard to do and we believe we can make an absolute unique contribution it's taken US 31 years to be here and we're still just beginning our journey and so this is insanely hard to do and uh uh When I Look Backwards I believe that we made I believe that that we're going to be remembered as a company that kind of changed everything not because we went out and changed everything through all the things that we said but because we did this one thing that was insanely hard to do that we're incredibly good at doing that we loved doing we did for a long time I'm part of the GSP lead I graduated in 2023 so my question is how do you see see your company in the next decade as what challenges do you see your company would face and how you are positioned for that first of all can I just tell you what was going on through my head as you say what challenges the list that flew by my head was so so large uh that that I was trying to figure out what to select um now the honest truth is is that when you ask that question most of the challenges that showed up for me were technical challenges and the reason for that is because that was my morning if you were to you know chosen yesterday um it might have been Market creation challenges there are some markets that I gosh I just desperately would love to create I just can't we just do it already you know but we can't do it alone Nvidia is a technology platform company we're here in service of a whole bunch of other the companies so that they could realize if you will our hopes and dreams through them and and so some of the things that I would love I would love for the world of biology to to be at a point where it's kind of like the world of Chip design 40 years ago computer AED and design um Eda that entire industry really made possible for us today and I believe we're going to make possible for them tomorrow computer AED drug design because we're able to now represent genes and proteins and even cells now very very close to be able to represent and understand the meaning of a cell a combination of a whole bunch of genes um what is a cell mean it's kind of like what does that paragraph mean well if we could understand a a cell like we can understand a paragraph imagine what we could do and so uh so so I'm I'm anxious for that to happen you know I'm kind of excited about that uh there's some that I'm just excited about that I know we around the corner on for example uh humanoid robotics very very close around the corner and the reason for that is because if you can tokenize and understand speech why can't you tokenize and understand uh manipulation and so so these kind of computer science techniques you once you figure something out you ask yourself well if got do that why can't I do that and so I'm excited about those kind of things um and so that challenge is kind of a happy challenge uh some of the some of the other challenges some of the other challenges of course are industrial and geopolitical and they're social and and but you've heard all that stuff before these are all true you know the social issues in in the world uh the geopolitical issues in the world uh why can't we just get along uh things in the world why do I have to say those kind of things in the world um why do we have to say those things and then amplify them in the world uh why do we have to judge people so much in the world uh you you know all those things you guys all know that I don't have to say those things over again my name is Jose I'm a class of the 2023 uh from the GSB my question is uh are you worried at all about the pace at which we're developing AI um and do you believe that any sort of Regulation might be needed thank you uh yeah that's uh the answer is yes and no um we need uh you you know that the the the greatest breakthrough in uh modern AI of course deep learning and it enabled great progress but another incredible breakthrough is something that that humans know and we practice all the time uh and we just invented it for uh for language models called uh grounding reinforcement learning human feedback um I provide reinforcement learning human feedback every day that's my job um and their for their parents in the room uh you're providing reinforcement learning human feedback all the time okay now we just figured out how to do that um at a system systematic level for artificial intelligence there are a whole bunch of other technology necessary to uh guardrail uh fine-tune ground for example how do I generate um how do I generate uh uh uh tokens that obey the laws of physics you know right now things are floating in space and doing things and they don't they don't obey the laws of physics um how do that requires technology Guard railing requires technology fine-tuning requires technology alignment requires technology safety requires technology the reason why planes are so safe is because you know all of the autopilot systems are are surrounded by diversity and redundancy and all kinds of different functional safety and active safety systems that were invented I need all of that to be invented much much faster uh you also know that that the border between security and artificial intelligence cyber security and artificial intelligence is going to become blurry and blurry we need technology to advance very very quickly in the area of cyber security in in order to protect us from artificial intelligence and so so in a lot of ways we need technology to go faster a lot faster okay uh regulation there's two types of Regulation uh there's social regulation I don't know what to do about that but there's product and services regulation know exactly what to do about that okay so um the fa the FAA the FDA the uh Nitsa you name it all the the fs and all the NS and all the you know fcc's the they all have regulations for products and services that are have particular use cases uh um uh bar exams and doctors and you know so on so forth um you all have uh qual qualification exams you all have standards that you have to reach you all have to uh continuously be certified uh accountants and so on so forth whether it's a product or a service there are lots and lots of regulations please do not add a super regulation that cuts across of it the regulator who is regulating accounting should not be the regulator that regulates a doctor you know I love accountants um but I I just you know if I ever need an open heart surgery the fact that they can close books is interesting but not sufficient and so and so I I would like I would like um all of those all of those fields that already have products and services um to also enhance their regulation in context of in the context of AI okay but I left out this one very big one which is this the social implication of AI and how do you how do you deal with that I don't have great answers for that um but you know enough people are talking about it but it's important to subdivide all of this into chunks does that make sense so that we don't we don't become super hyperfocused on this one thing at the expense of a whole bunch of routine things that we could have done and as a result people are getting killed by cars and planes and you know it doesn't make any sense we should make sure that we we do the right things there okay very practical things may I take one more question well we have some rapid fire questions for you as view from the tradition okay I was trying to avoid that okay all right far away far away well your first job was at Denny's they now have a booth dedicated to you what was your fondest memory of working my second job was AMD by the way is there Booth dedicated to me there I'm just kidding um I'm I love my job there I did I love there it's a great company yeah yeah um if there were a worldwide shortage of black leather jackets what would we be see you wearing oh no I've I've got a large reservoir of black jackets I'm the I'll be the only person who is who is not concerned um you spoke a lot about textbooks if you had to write one what would it be called I wouldn't write one you're asking me a hypothetical question that has no possibility of of of uh that's fair and finally if you could share one parting piece of advice to broadcast across Stanford what would it be uh it's not a word but but um I you know have a core belief um gut check it every day I pursue it with all your might pursue it for a very long time surround yourself with people you love and take them on that right so that's the story of Nvidia Jensen this last hour has been a treat thank you for spending thank you very much [Music]

Brilliant Minds everywhere please welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Wong welcome to GTC I hope you realize this is not a concert you have arrived at a developers conference there will be a lot of science described algorithms computer architecture mathematics I sensed a very heavy weight in the room all of a sudden almost like you were in the wrong place no no conference in the world is there a great assembly of researchers from such diverse fields of science from climatech to radio Sciences trying to figure out how to use AI to robotically control MOS for Next Generation 6G radios robotic self-driving car s even artificial intelligence even artificial intelligence everybody's first I noticed a sense of relief there all of all of a sudden also this conference is represented by some amazing companies this list this is not the attendees these are the presentors and what's amazing is this if you take away all of my friends close friends Michael Dell is sitting right there in the IT industry all of the friends I grew up with in the industry if you take away that list this is what's amazing these are the presenters of the non it Industries using accelerated Computing to solve problems that normal computers can't it's represented in life sciences healthc Care genomics Transportation of course retail Logistics manufacturing industrial the gamut of Industries represented is truly amazing and you're not here to attend only you're here to present to talk about your research $100 trillion dollar of the world's Industries is represented in this room today this is absolutely amazing there is absolutely something happening there is something going on the industry is being transformed not just ours because the computer industry the computer is the single most important instrument of society today fundamental transformations in Computing affects every industry but how did we start how did we get here I made a little cartoon for you literally I drew this in one page this is nvidia's Journey started in 1993 this might be the rest of the talk 1993 this is our journey we were founded in 1993 there are several important events that happen along the way I'll just highlight a few in 2006 Cuda which has turned out to have been a revolutionary Computing model we thought it was revolutionary then it was going to be an overnight success and almost 20 years later it happened we saw it coming two decades later in 2012 alexnet Ai and Cuda made first Contact in 2016 recognizing the importance of this Computing model we invented a brand new type of computer we called the dgx one 170 Tera flops in this supercomputer eight gpus connected together for the very first time I hand delivered the very first dgx-1 to a startup located in San Francisco called open AI dgx-1 was the world's first AI supercomputer remember 170 Tera flops 2017 the Transformer arrived 2022 chat GPT capture the world's imag imaginations have people realize the importance and the capabilities of artificial intelligence and 2023 generative AI emerged and a new industry begins why why is a new industry because the software never existed before we are now producing software using computers to write software producing software that never existed before it is a brand new category it took share from nothing it's a brand new category and the way you produce the software is unlike anything we've ever done before in data centers generating tokens producing floating Point numbers at very large scale as if in the beginning of this last Industrial Revolution when people realized that you would set up factories apply energy to it and this invisible valuable thing called electricity came out AC generators and 100 years later 200 years later we are now creating new types of electrons tokens using infrastructure we call factories AI factories to generate this new incredibly valuable thing called artificial intelligence a new industry has emerged well well we're going to talk about many things about this new industry we're going to talk about how we're going to do Computing next we're going to talk about the type of software that you build because of this new industry the new software how you would think about this new software what about applications in this new industry and then maybe what's next and how can we start preparing today for what is about to come next well but before I start I want to show you the soul of Nvidia the soul of our company at the intersection of computer Graphics physics and artificial intelligence all intersecting inside a computer in Omniverse in a virtual world simulation everything we're going to show you today literally everything we're going to show you today is a simulation not animation it's only beautiful because it's physics the world is beautiful it's only amazing because it's being animated with robotics it's being animated with artificial intelligence what you're about to see all day it's completely generated completely simulated and Omniverse and all of it what you're about to enjoy is the world's first concert where everything is homemade everything is homemade you're about to watch some home videos so sit back and enjoy yourself m what a God I love it Nvidia accelerated Computing has reached the Tipping Point general purpose Computing has run out of steam we need another way of doing Computing so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing so that we can continue to consume more and more Computing while being sustainable accelerated Computing is a dramatic speed up over general purpose Computing and in every single industry we engage and I'll show you many the impact is dramatic but in no industry is a more important than our own the industry of using simulation tools to create products in this industry it is not about driving down the cost of computing it's about driving up the scale of computing we would like to be able to sim at the entire product that we do completely in full Fidelity completely digitally in essentially what we call digital twins we would like to design it build it simulate it operate it completely digitally in order to do that we need to accelerate an entire industry and today I would like to announce that we have some Partners who are joining us in this journey to accelerate their entire ecosystem so that we can bring the world into accelerated Computing but there's a bonus when you become accelerated your infrastructure is cou to gpus and when that happens it's exactly the same infrastructure for generative Ai and so I'm just delighted to announce several very important Partnerships there are some of the most important companies in the world and Anis does engineering simulation for what the world makes we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the ancis ecosystem to connect anus to the Omniverse digital twin incredible the thing that's really great is that the install base of media GPU accelerated systems are all over the world in every cloud in every system all over Enterprises and so the app the applications they accelerate will have a giant installed base to go serve end users will have amazing applications and of course system makers and csps will have great customer demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally first software partner they were there in very first day of our company synopsis revolutionized the chip industry with high level design we are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're accelerating computational lithography one of the most important applications that nobody's ever known about in order to make chips we have to push lithography to limit Nvidia has created a library domain specific library that accelerates computational lithography incredibly once we can accelerate and software Define all of tsmc who is announcing today that they're going to go into production with Nvidia kitho once this software defined and accelerated the next step is to apply generative AI to the future of semiconductor manufacturing push in Geometry even further Cadence builds the world's essential Eda and SDA tools we also use Cadence between these three companies ansis synopsis and Cadence we basically build Nvidia together we are cud accelerating Cadence they're also building a supercomputer out of Nvidia gpus so that their customers could do fluid Dynamic simulation at a 100 a thousand times scale basically a wind tunnel in real time Cadence Millennium a supercomputer with Nvidia gpus inside a software company building supercomputers I love seeing that building Cadence co-pilots together imagine a day when Cadence could synopsis ansis tool providers would offer you AI co-pilots so that we have thousands and thousands of co-pilot assistants helping us design chips Design Systems and we're also going to connect Cadence digital twin platform to Omniverse as you could see the trend here we're accelerating the world's CAE Eda and SDA so that we could create our future in digital Twins and we're going to connect them all to Omniverse the fundamental operating system for future digital twins one of the industries that benefited tremendously from scale and you know you all know this one very well large language model basically after the Transformer was invented we were able to scale large language models at incredible rates effectively doubling every six months now how is it possible that by doubling every six months that we have grown the industry we have grown the computational requirements so far and the reason for that is quite simply this if you double the size of the model you double the size of your brain you need twice as much information to go fill it and so every time you double your parameter count you also have to appropriately increase your training token count the combination of those two numbers becomes the computation scale you have to support the latest the state-of-the-art open AI model is approximately 1.8 trillion parameters 1.8 trillion parameters required several trillion tokens to go train so so a few trillion parameters on the order of a few trillion tokens on the order of when you multiply the two of them together approximately 30 40 50 billion quadrillion floating Point operations per second now we just have to do some Co math right now just hang hang with me so you have 30 billion quadrillion a quadrillion is like a paa and so if you had a PA flop GPU you would need 30 billion seconds to go compute to go train that model 30 billion seconds is approximately 1,000 years well 1,000 years it's worth it like to do it sooner but it's worth it which is usually my answer when most people tell me hey how long how long's it going to take to do something 20 years how it it's worth it but can we do it next week and so 1,000 years 1,000 years so what we need what we need are bigger gpus we need much much bigger gpus we recognized this early on and we realized that the answer is to put a whole bunch of gpus together and of course innovate a whole bunch of things along the way like inventing 10 censor cores advancing MV links so that we could create essentially virtually Giant gpus and connecting them all together with amazing networks from a company called melanox infiniband so that we could create these giant systems and so djx1 was our first version but it wasn't the last we built we built supercomputers all the way all along the way in 2021 we had Seline 4500 gpus or so and then in 2023 we built one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world it's just come online EOS and as we're building these things we're trying to help the world build these things and in order to help the world build these things we got to build them first we build the chips the systems the networking all of the software necessary to do this you should see these systems imagine writing a piece of software that runs across the entire system Distributing the computation across thousands of gpus but inside are thousands of smaller gpus millions of gpus to distribute work across all of that and to balance the workload so that you can get the most Energy Efficiency the best computation time keep your cost down and so those those fundamental Innovations is what got us here and here we are as we see the miracle of chat GPT emerg in front of us we also realize we have a long ways to go we need even larger models we're going to train it with multimodality data not just text on the internet but we're going to we're going to train it on texts and images and graphs and charts and just as we learn watching TV and so there's going to be a whole bunch of watching video so that these Mo models can be grounded in physics understands that an arm doesn't go through a wall and so these models would have common sense by watching a lot of the world's video combined with a lot of the world's languages it'll use things like synthetic data generation just as you and I do when we try to learn we might use our imagination to simulate how it's going to end up just as I did when I Was preparing for this keynote I was simulating it all along the way I hope it's going to turn out as well as I had it in my head as I was simulating how this keynote was going to turn out somebody did say that another performer did her performance completely on a treadmill so that she could be in shape to deliver it with full energy I I didn't do that if I get a l wind at about 10 minutes into this you know what happened and so so where were we we're sitting here using synthetic data generation we're going to use reinforcement learning we're going to practice it in our mind we're going to have ai working with AI training each other just like student teacher Debaters all of that is going to increase the size of our model it's going to increase the amount of the amount of data that we have and we're going to have to build even bigger gpus Hopper is fantastic but we need bigger gpus and so ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to a very very big GPU named after David Blackwell math ician game theorists probability we thought it was a perfect per per perfect name black wealth ladies and gentlemen enjoy this the com Blackwell is not a chip Blackwell is the name of a platform uh people think we make gpus and and we do but gpus don't look the way they used to here here's the here's the here's the the if you will the heart of the blackw system and this inside the company is not called Blackwell it's just the number and um uh this this is Blackwell sitting next to oh this is the most advanced GPU in the world in production today this is Hopper this is Hopper Hopper changed the world this is Blackwell it's okay Hopper you're you're very good good good boy well good girl 208 billion transistors and so so you could see you I can see that there's a small line between two dyes this is the first time two dieses have abutted like this together in such a way that the two chip the two dieses think it's one chip there's 10 terabytes of data between it 10 terabytes per second so that these two these two sides of the Blackwell Chip have no clue which side they're on there's no memory locality issues no cach issues it's just one giant chip and so uh when we were told that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond the limits of physics uh the engineer said so what and so this is what what happened and so this is the Blackwell chip and it goes into two types of systems the first one is form fit function compatible to Hopper and so you slide all Hopper and you push in Blackwell that's the reason why one of the challenges of ramping is going to be so efficient there are installations of Hoppers all over the world and they could be they could be you know the same infrastructure same design the power the electricity The Thermals the software identical push it right back and so this is a hopper version for the current hgx configuration and this is what the other the second Hopper looks like this now this is a prototype board and um Janine could I just borrow ladies and gentlemen Jan Paul and so this this is the this is a fully functioning board and I just be careful here this right here is I don't know10 billion the second one's five it gets cheaper after that so any customers in the audience it's okay all right but this is this one's quite expensive this is to bring up board and um and the the way it's going to go to production is like this one here okay and so you're going to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected to a Grace CPU the grace CPU has a super fast chipto chip link what's amazing is this computer is the first of its kind where this much computation first of all fits into this small of a place second it's memory coherent they feel like they're just one big happy family working on one application together and so everything is coherent within it um the just the amount of you know you saw the numbers there's a lot of terabytes this and terabytes that's um but this is this is a miracle this is a this let's see what are some of the things on here uh there's um uh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on on uh your which one is mine and your left one of them it doesn't matter uh one of them one of them is a CPU chipto chip link is my left or your depending on which side I was just I was trying to sort that out and I just kind of doesn't matter hopefully it comes plugged in so okay so this is the grace Blackwell system but there's more so it turns out it turns out all of the specs is fantastic but we need a whole lot of new features uh in order to push the limits Beyond if you will the limits of physics we would like to always get a lot more X factors and so one of the things that we did was We Invented another Transformer engine another Transformer engine the second generation it has the ability to dynamically and automatically rescale and recas numerical formats to a lower Precision whenever it can remember artificial intelligence is about probability and so you kind of have you know 1.7 approximately 1.7 time approximately 1.4 to be approximately something else does that make sense and so so the the ability for the mathematics to retain the Precision and the range necessary in that particular stage of the pipeline super important and so this is it's not just about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU it's not quite the world's not quite that simple you've got to figure out when you can use that across a computation that is thousands of gpus it's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you want to make sure that the the uh uh the training job is going going to converge and so this new Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV link it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very importantly it has computation in the network and the reason for that is because when you have so many different gpus working together we have to share our information with each other we have to synchronize and update each other and every so often we have to reduce the partial products and then rebroadcast out the partial products the sum of the partial products back to everybody else and so there's a lot of what is called all reduce and all to all and all gather it's all part of this area of synchronization and collectives so that we can have gpus working with each other having extraordinarily fast links and being able to do mathematics right in the network allows us to essentially amplify even further so even though it's 1.8 terabytes per second it's effectively higher than that and so it's many times that of Hopper the likel Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on in is approximately zero and the reason for that is because there's so many components working at the same time the statistic the probability of them working continuously is very low and so we need to make sure that whenever there is a well we checkpoint and restart as often as we can but if we have the ability to detect a weak chip or a weak note early we could retire it and maybe swap in another processor that ability to keep the utilization of the supercomputer High especially when you just spent $2 billion building it is super important and so we put in a Ras engine a reliability engine that does 100% self test in system test of every single gate every single bit of memory on the Blackwell chip and all the memory that's connected to it it's almost as if we shipped with every single chip its own Advanced tester that we CH test our chips with this is the first time we're doing this super excited about it secure AI only this conference do they clap for Ras the the uh secure AI uh obviously you've just spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating a very important Ai and the the code the intelligence of that AI is encoded in the parameters you want to make sure that on the one hand you don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get contaminated and so we now have the ability to encrypt data of course at rest but also in transit and while it's being computed it's all encrypted and so we now have the ability to encrypt and transmission and when we're Computing it it is in a trusted trusted environment trusted uh engine environment and the last thing is decompression moving data in and out of these nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really essential and so we've put in a high linee speed compression engine and effectively moves data 20 times times faster in and out of these computers these computers are are so powerful and there's such a large investment the last thing we want to do is have them be idle and so all of these capabilities are intended to keep Blackwell fed and as busy as possible overall compared to Hopper it is two and a half times two and a half times the fp8 performance for training per chip it is ALS it also has this new format called fp6 so that even though the computation speed is the same the bandwidth that's Amplified because of the memory the amount of parameters you can store in the memory is now Amplified fp4 effectively doubles the throughput this is vitally important for inference one of the things that that um is becoming very clear is that whenever you use a computer with AI on the other side when you're chatting with the chatbot when you're asking it to uh review or make an image remember in the back is a GPU generating tokens some people call it inference but it's more appropriately generation the way that Computing is done in the past was retrieval you would grab your phone you would touch something um some signals go off basically an email goes off to some storage somewhere there's pre-recorded content somebody wrote a story or somebody made an image or somebody recorded a video that record pre-recorded content is then streamed back to the phone and recomposed in a way based on a recommender system to present the information to you you know that in the future the vast majority of that content will not be retrieved and the reason for that is because that was pre-recorded by somebody who doesn't understand the context which is the reason why we have to retrieve so much content if you can be working with an AI that understands the context who you are for what reason you're fetching this information and produces the information for you just the way you like it the amount of energy we save the amount of networking bandwidth we save the amount of waste of time we save will be tremendous the future is generative which is the reason why we call it generative AI which is the reason why this is a brand new industry the way we compute is fundamentally different we created a processor for the generative AI era and one of the most important parts of it is content token generation we call it this format is fp4 well that's a lot of computation 5x the Gen token generation 5x the inference capability of Hopper seems like enough but why stop there the answer is it's not enough and I'm going to show you why I'm going to show you why and so we would like to have a bigger GPU even bigger than this one and so we decided to scale it and notice but first let me just tell you how we've scaled over the course of the last eight years we've increased computation by 1,000 times8 years 1,000 times remember back in the good old days of Moore's Law it was 2x well 5x every what 10 10x every 5 years that's easier easiest math 10x every 5 years a 100 times every 10 years 100 times every 10 years at the in the middle in the hey days of the PC Revolution one 100 times every 10 years in the last 8 years we've gone 1,000 times we have two more years to go and so that puts it in perspective the rate at which we're advancing Computing is insane and it's still not fast enough so we built another chip this chip is just an incredible chip we call it the Envy link switch it's 50 billion transistors it's almost the size of Hopper all by itself this switch ship has four MV links in it each 1.8 terabytes per second and and it has computation in as I mentioned what is this chip for if we were to build such a chip we can have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at full speed at the same time that's insane it doesn't even make sense but if you could do that if you can find a way to do that and build a system to do that that's cost effective that's cost effective how incredible would it be that we could have all these gpus connect over a coherent link so that they effectively are one giant GPU well one of one of the Great Inventions in order to make a cost effective is that this chip has to drive copper directly the seres of this chip is is just a phenomenal invention so that we could do direct drive to copper and as a result you can build a system that looks like this now this system this system is kind of insane this is one dgx this is what a dgx looks like now remember just six years ago it was pretty heavy but I was able to lift it I delivered the uh the uh first djx1 to open Ai and and the researchers there it's on you know the pictures are on the internet and uh uh and we all autographed it uh and um uh if you come to my office it's autographed there is really beautiful and but but you could lift it uh this dgx this dgx that djx by the way was 170 teraflops if you're not familiar with the numbering system that's 0.17 pedop flops so this is 720 the first one I delivered to open AI was 0.17 you could round it up to 0.2 won't make any difference but and back then was like wow you know 30 more teraflops and so this is now 720 pedop flops almost an exal flop for training and the world's first one exal flops machine in one rack just so you know there are only a couple two three exop flops machines on the planet as we speak and so this is an exop flops AI system in one single rack well let's take a look at the back of it so this is what makes it possible that's the back that's the that's the back the dgx MV link spine 130 terabytes per second goes through the back of that chassis that is more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet so we we could basically send everything to everybody within a second and so so we we have 5,000 cables 5,000 mvlink cables in total 2 miles now this is the amazing thing if we had to use Optics we would have had to use transceivers and retim and those transceivers and reers alone would have cost 20,000 watts 2 kilowatts of just transceivers alone just to drive the mvlink spine as a result we did it completely for free over mvlink switch and we were able to save the 20 kilow for computation this entire rack is 120 kilowatts so that 20 kilowatts makes a huge difference it's liquid cooled what goes in is 25° C about room temperature what comes out is 45°c about your jacuzzi so room temperature goes in jacuzzi comes out 2 liters per second we could we could sell a peripheral 600,000 Parts somebody used to say you know you guys make gpus and we do but this is what a GPU looks like to me when somebody says GPU I see this two years ago when I saw a GPU was the hgx it was 70 lb 35,000 Parts our gpus now are 600,000 parts and 3,000 lb 3,000 lb 3,000 lb that's kind of like the weight of a you know Carbon Fiber Ferrari I don't know if that's useful metric but everybody's going I feel it I feel it I get it I get that now that you mention that I feel it I don't know what's 3,000 lb okay so 3,000 lb ton and a half so it's not quite an elephant so this is what a dgx looks like now let's see what it looks like in operation okay let's imagine what is what how do we put this to work and what does that mean well if you were to train a GPT model 1.8 trillion parameter model it took it took about apparently about you know 3 to 5 months or so uh with 25,000 amp uh if we were to do it with hopper it would probably take something like 8,000 gpus and it would consume 15 megawatts 8,000 gpus on 15 megawatts it would take 90 days about 3 months and that would allows you to train something that is you know this groundbreaking AI model and this is obviously not as expensive as as um as anybody would think but it's 8,000 8,000 gpus it's still a lot of money and so 8,000 gpus 15 megawatts if you were to use Blackwell to do this it would only take 2,000 gpus 2,000 gpus same 90 days but this is the amazing part only 4 me GS of power so from 15 yeah that's right and that's and that's our goal our goal is to continuously drive down the cost and the energy they're directly proportional to each other cost and energy associated with the Computing so that we can continue to expand and scale up the computation that we have to do to train the Next Generation models well this is training inference or generation is vitally important going forward you know probably some half of the time that Nvidia gpus are in the cloud these days it's being used for token generation you know they're either doing co-pilot this or chat you know chat GPT that or um all these different models that are being used when you're interacting with it or generating IM generating images or generating videos generating proteins generating chemicals there's a bunch of gener generation going on all of that is B in the category of computing we call inference but inference is extremely hard for large language models because these large language models have several properties one they're very large and so it doesn't fit on one GPU this is Imagine imagine Excel doesn't fit on one GPU you know and imagine some application you're running on a daily basis doesn't run doesn't fit on one computer like a video game doesn't fit on one computer and most in fact do and many times in the past in hyperscale Computing many applic applications for many people fit on the same computer and now all of a sudden this one inference application where you're interacting with this chatbot that chatbot requires a supercomputer in the back to run it and that's the future the future is generative with these chatbots and these chatbots are trillions of tokens trillions of parameters and they have to generate tokens at interactive rates now what does that mean well uh three to tokens is about a word I you know the the uh you know space the final frontier these are the adventures that's like that's like 80 tokens okay I don't know if that's useful to you and so you know the art of communications is is selecting good an good analogies yeah this is this is not going well every I don't know what he's talking about never seen Star Trek and so and so so here we are we're trying to generate these tokens when you're interacting with it you're hoping that the tokens come back to you as quickly as possible and as quickly as you can read it and so the ability for Generation tokens is really important you have to paralyze the work of this model across many many gpus so that you could achieve several things one on the one hand you would like throughput because that throughput reduces the cost the overall cost per token of uh generating so your throughput dictates the cost of of uh delivering the service on the other hand you have another interactive rate which is another tokens per second where it's about per user and that has everything to do with quality of service and so these two things um uh compete against each other and we have to find a way to distribute work across all of these different gpus and paralyze it in a way that allows us to achieve both and it turns out the search search space is enormous you know I told you there's going to be math involved and everybody's going oh dear I heard some gasp just now when I put up that slide you know so so this this right here the the y axis is tokens per second data center throughput the x- axis is tokens per second interactivity of the person and notice the upper right is the best you want interactivity to be very High number of tokens per second per user you want the tokens per second of per data center to be very high the upper upper right is is terrific however it's very hard to do that and in order for us to search for the best answer across every single one of those intersections XY coordinates okay so you just look at every single XY coordinate all those blue dots came from some repartitioning of the software some optimizing solution has to go and figure out what whether to use use tensor parallel expert parallel pipeline parallel or data parallel and distribute this enormous model across all these G different gpus and sustain performance that you need this exploration space would be impossible if not for the programmability of nvidia's gpus and so we could because of Cuda because we have such Rich ecosystem we could explore this universe and find that green roof line it turns out that green roof line notice you got tp2 EPA dp4 it means two parall two uh tensor parallel tensor parallel across two gpus expert parallels across eight data parallel across four notice on the other end you got tensor parallel cross 4 and expert parallel across 16 the configuration the distribution of that software it's a different different um runtime that would produce these different results and you have to go discover that roof line well that's just one model and this is just one configuration of a computer imagine all of the models being created around the world and all the different different um uh configurations of of uh systems that are going to be available so now that you understand the basics let's take a look at inference of Blackwell compared to Hopper and this is this is the extraordinary thing in one generation because we created a system that's designed for trillion parameter gener generative AI the inference capability of Blackwell is off the charts and in fact it is some 30 times Hopper y for large language models for large language models like Chad GPT and others like it the blue line is Hopper I gave you imagine we didn't change the architecture of Hopper we just made it a bigger chip we just used the latest you know greatest uh 10 terab you know terabytes per second we connected the two chips together we got this giant 208 billion parameter chip how would we have performed if nothing else changed and it turns out quite wonderfully quite wonderfully and that's the purple line but not as great as it could be and and that's where the fp4 tensor core the new Transformer engine and very importantly the MV link switch and the reason for that is because all these gpus have to share the results partial products whenever they do all to all all all gather whenever they communicate with each other that mvlink switch is communicating almost 10 times faster than what we could do in the past using the fastest networks Okay so Blackwell is going to be just an amazing system for a generative Ai and in the future in the future data centers are going to be thought of as I mentioned earlier as an AI Factory an AI Factory's goal in life is to generate revenues generate in this case intelligence in this facility not generating electricity as in AC generator but of the last Industrial Revolution and this Industrial Revolution the generation of intelligence and so this ability is super super important the excitement of Blackwell is really off the charts you know when we first when we first um uh you know this this is a year and a half ago two years ago I guess two years ago when we first started to to go to market with hopper you know we had the benefit of of uh two two uh two csps uh joined us in a lunch and and we were you know delighted um and so we had two customers uh we have more now unbelievable excitement for Blackwell unbelievable excitement and there's a whole bunch of different configurations of course I showed you the configurations that slide into the hopper form factor so that's easy to upgrade I showed you examples that are liquid cooled that are the extreme versions of it one entire rack that's that's uh connected by mvlink 72 uh we're going to Blackwell is going to be ramping to the world's AI companies of which there are so many now doing amazing work in different modalities the csps every CSP is geared up all the OEM and odms Regional clouds Sovereign AIS and Telos all over the world are signing up to launch with Blackwell this Blackwell Blackwell would be the the the most successful product launch in our history and so I can't wait wait to see that um I want to thank I want to thank some partners that that are joining us in this uh AWS is gearing up for Blackwell they're uh they're going to build the first uh GPU with secure AI they're uh building out a 222 exf flops system you know just now when we animated uh just now the digital twin if you saw the the all of those clusters are coming down by the way that is not just art that is a digital twin of what we're building that's how big it's going to be besides infrastructure we're doing a lot of things together with AWS we're Cuda accelerating stag maker AI we're Cuda accelerating Bedrock AI uh Amazon robotics is working with us uh using Nvidia Omniverse and Isaac Sim AWS Health has Nvidia Health Integrated into it so AWS has has really leaned into accelerated Computing uh Google is gearing up for Blackwell gcp already has A1 100s h100s t4s l4s a whole Fleet of Nvidia Cuda gpus and they recently announced the Gemma model that runs across all of it uh we're work working to optimize uh and accelerate every aspect of gcp we're accelerating data proc which for data processing their data processing engine Jax xlaa vertex Ai and mojoko for robotics so we're working with uh Google and gcp across a whole bunch of initiatives uh Oracle is gearing up for black wellth Oracle is a great partner of ours for Nvidia dgx cloud and we're also working together to accelerate something that's really important to a lot of companies Oracle database Microsoft is accelerating and Microsoft is gearing up for Blackwell Microsoft Nvidia has a wide- ranging partnership we're accelerating Cuda accelerating all kinds of services when you when you chat obviously and uh AI services that are in Microsoft Azure uh it's very very likely Nvidia is in the back uh doing the inference and the token generation uh we built they built the largest Nvidia infiniband supercomputer basically a digital twin of hours or a physical twin of hours uh we're bringing the Nvidia ecosystem to Azure Nvidia djx cloud to Azure uh Nvidia Omniverse is now hosted in Azure Nvidia Healthcare is an Azure and all of it is deeply integrated and deeply connected with Microsoft fabric the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell this is what I'm about to show you most of the most of the the the uh uh uh scenes that you've seen so far of Blackwell are the are the full Fidelity design of Blackwell everything in our company has a digital twin and in fact this digital twin idea is it is really spreading and it it helps it helps companies build very complicated things perfectly the first time and what could be more exciting than creating a digital twin to build a computer that was built in a digital twin and so let me show you what wistron is doing to meet the demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing widraw one of our leading manufacturing Partners is building digital twins of Nvidia dgx and hgx factories using custom software developed with Omniverse sdks and apis for their newest Factory wraw started with a digital twin to virtually integrate their multi-ad and process simulation data into a unified view testing and optimizing layouts in this physically accurate digital environment increased worker efficency icy by 51% during construction the Omniverse digital twin was used to verify that the physical build matched the digital plans identifying any discrepancies early has helped avoid costly change orders and the results have been impressive using a digital twin helped bring wion's Factory online in half the time just 2 and 1/2 months instead of five in operation the Omniverse digital twin helps widraw rapidly Test new layouts to accommodate new processes or improve operations in the existing space and monitor real-time operations using live iot data from every machine on the production line which ultimately enabled wion to reduce End to-end Cycle Times by 50% and defect rates by 40% with Nvidia Ai and Omniverse nvidia's Global ecosystem of partners are building a new era of accelerated AI enabled digitalization that's how we that's the way it's going to be in the future we're going to manufacturing everything digitally first and then we'll manufacture it physically people ask me how did it start what got you guys so excited what was it that you saw that caused you to put it all in on this incredible idea and it's this hang on a second guys that was going to be such a moment that's what happens when you don't rehearse this as you know was first Contact 20 12 alexnet you put a cat into this computer and it comes out and it says cat and we said oh my God this is going to change everything you take 1 million numbers you take one Million numbers across three channels RGB these numbers make no sense to anybody you put it into this software and it compress it dimensionally reduce it it reduces it from a million dimensions a million Dimensions it turns it into three letters one vector one number and it's generalized you could have the cat be different cats and and you could have it be the front of the cat and the back of the cat and you look at this thing you say unbelievable you mean any cats yeah any cat and it was able to recognize all these cats and we realized how it did it systematically structurally it's scalable how big can you make it well how big do you want to make it and so we imagine that this is a completely new way of writing software and now today as you know you could have you type in the word c a and what comes out is a cat it went the other way am I right unbelievable how is it possible that's right how is it possible you took three letters and you generated a million pixels from it and it made sense well that's the miracle and here we are just literally 10 years later 10 years later where we recognize textt we recognize images we recognize videos and sounds and images not only do we recognize them we understand their meaning we understand the meaning of the text that's the reason why it can chat with you it can summarize for you it understands the text it understood not just recognizes the the English it understood the English it doesn't just recognize the pixels and understood the pixels and you can you can even condition it between two modalities you can have language condition image and generate all kinds of interesting things well if you can understand these things what else can you understand that you've digitized the reason why we started with text and you know images is because we digitized those but what else have we digitized well it turns out we digitized a lot of things proteins and genes and brain waves anything you can digitize so long as there's structure we can probably learn some patterns from it and if we can learn the patterns from it we can understand its meaning if we can understand its meaning we might be able to generate it as well and so therefore the generative AI Revolution is here well what else can we generate what else can we learn well one of the things that we would love to learn we would love to learn is we would love to learn climate we would love to learn extreme weather we would love to learn uh what how we can predict future weather at Regional scales at sufficiently high resolution such that we can keep people out of Harm's Way before harm comes extreme weather cost the world $150 billion surely more than that and it's not evenly distributed $150 billion is concentrated in some parts of the world and of course to some people of the world we need to adapt and we need to know what's coming and so we are creating Earth too a digital twin of the Earth for predicting weather we and we've made an extraordinary invention called Civ the ability to use generative AI to predict weather at extremely high resolution let's take a look as the earth's climate changes AI powered weather forecasting is allowing us to more accurately predict and track severe storms like super typhoon chanthu which caused widespread damage in Taiwan and the surrounding region in 2021 current AI forecast models can accurately predict the track of storms but they are limited to 25 km resolution which can miss important details Invidia cordi is a revolutionary new generative AI model trained on high resolution radar assimilated Warf weather forecasts and air 5 reanalysis data using cordi extreme events like chanthu can be super resolved from 25 km to 2 km resolution with 1,000 times the speed and 3,000 times the Energy Efficiency of conventional weather models by combining the speed and accuracy of nvidia's weather forecasting model forecast net and generative AI models like cordi we can explore hundreds or even thousands of kilometer scale Regional weather forecasts to provide a clear picture of the best worst and most likely impacts of a storm this wealth of information can help minimize loss of life and property damage today cordi is optimized for Taiwan but soon generative super sampling will be available as part of the in viia Earth 2 inference service for many regions across the globe the weather company has the trust a source of global weather predictions we are working together to accelerate their weather simulation first principled base of simulation however they're also going to integrate Earth to cordi so that they could help businesses and countries do Regional high resolution weather prediction and so if you have some weather prediction you'd like to know like to do uh reach out to the weather company really exciting really exciting work Nvidia Healthcare something we started 15 years ago we're super super excited about this this is an area where we're very very proud whether it's Medical Imaging or genene sequencing or computational chemistry it is very likely that Nvidia is the computation behind it we've done so much work in this area today we're announcing that we're going to do something really really cool imagine all of these AI models that are being used to generate images and audio but instead of images and audio because it understood images and audio all the digitization that we've done for genes and proteins and amino acids that digitalization capability is now now passed through machine learning so that we understand the language of Life the ability to understand the language of Life of course we saw the first evidence of it with alphafold this is really quite an extraordinary thing after Decades of painstaking work the world had only digitized and reconstructed using cor electron microscopy or Crystal XR x-ray crystallography um these different techniques painstaking reconstructed the protein 200,000 of them in just what is it less than a year or so Alpha fold has reconstructed 200 million proteins basically every protein every of every living thing that's ever been sequenced this is completely revolutionary well those models are incredibly hard to use um for incredibly hard for people to build and so what we're going to do is we're going to build them we're going to build them for uh the the researchers around the world and it won't be the only one there'll be many other models that we create and so let me show you what we're going to do with it virtual screening for new medicines is a computationally intractable problem existing techniques can only scan billions of compounds and require days on thousands of standard compute nodes to identify new drug candidates Nvidia biion Nemo Nims enable a new generative screening Paradigm using Nims for protein structure prediction with Alpha fold molecule generation with MIM and docking with diff dock we can now generate and Screen candidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM can connect to custom applications to steer the generative process iteratively optimizing for desired properties these applications can be defined with biion Nemo microservices or built from scratch here a physics based simulation optimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to a Target protein while optimizing for other favorable molecular properties in parallel MIM generates high quality drug-like molecules that bind to the Target and are synthesizable translating to a higher probability of developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with Nims providing OnDemand microservices that can be combined to build powerful drug Discovery workflows like denovo protein design or ided molecule generation for virtual screening bio Nims are helping researchers and developers reinvent computational drug design Nvidia M MIM MIM cord diff there's a whole bunch of other models whole bunch of other models computer vision models robotics models and even of course some really really terrific open source language models these models are groundbreaking however it's hard for companies to use how would you use it how would you bring it into your company and integrate it into your workflow how would you package it up and run it remember earlier I just said that inference is an extraordinary computation problem how would you do the optimization for each and every one of these models and put together the Computing stack necessary to run that supercomputer so that you can run the models in your company and so we have a great idea we're going to invent a new way invent a new way for you to receive and operate software this software comes basically in a digital box we call it a container and we call it the Nvidia inference micr service a Nim and let me explain to you what it is a Nim it's a pre-trained model so it's pretty clever and it is packaged and optimized to run across nvidia's install base which is very very large what's inside it is incredible you have all these pre-trained state-ofthe-art open source models they could be open source they could be from one of our partners it could be created by us like Nvidia mull it is packaged up with all of its dependencies so Cuda the right version CNN the right version tensor RT llm Distributing across the multiple gpus Tred and inference server all completely packaged together it's optimized depending on whether you have a single GPU multi- GPU or multi node of gpus it's optimized for that and it's connected up with apis that are simple to use now this think about what an AI API is an AI API is an interface that you just talk to and so this is a piece of software in the future that has a really simple API and that API called human and these packages incredible bodies of software will be optimized and packaged and we'll put it on a website and you can download it you could take it with you you could run it in any Cloud you can run it in your own data center you can run in workstations if it fit and all you have to do is come to ai. nvidia.com we call it Nvidia inference microservice but inside the company we all call it Nims okay just imagine you know one of some someday there there's going to be one of these chat Bots and these chat Bots is going to just be in a Nim and you you'll uh you'll assemble a whole bunch of chat Bots and that's the way software is going to be be built someday how do we build software in the future it is unlikely that you'll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of python code or anything like that it is very likely that you assemble a team of AIS there's probably going to be a super AI that you use that takes the mission that you give it and breaks it down into an execution plan some of that execution plan could be handed off to another Nim that Nim would maybe uh understand sap the language of sap is abap it might understand service now and it go retrieve some information from their platforms it might then hand that result to another Nim who that goes off and does some calculation on it maybe it's an optimization software a combinatorial optimization algorithm maybe it's uh you know some just some basic calculator maybe it's pandas to do some numerical analysis on it and then it comes back with its answer and it gets combined with everybody else's and it because it's been presented with this is what the right answer should look like it knows what answer what an what right answers to produce and it presents it to you we can get a report every single day at you know top of the hour uh that has something to do with a bill plan or some forecast or uh some customer alert or some bugs database or whatever it happens to be and we could assemble it using all these Nims and because these Nims have been packaged up and ready to work on your systems so long as you have video gpus in your data center in the cloud this this Nims will work together as a team and do amazing things and so we decided this is such a great idea we're going to go do that and so Nvidia has Nims running all over the company we have chatbots being created all over the place and one of the mo most important chatbots of course is a chip designer chatbot you might not be surprised we care a lot about building chips and so we want to build chatbots AI co-pilots that are co-designers with our engineers and so this is the way we did it so we got ourselves a llama llama 2 this is a 70b and it's you know packaged up in a NM and we asked it you know uh what is a CTL Well turns out CTL is an internal uh program and it has a internal proprietary language but it thought the CTL was a combinatorial timing logic and so it describes you know conventional knowledge of CTL but that's not very useful to us and so we gave it a whole bunch of new examples you know this is no different than employee onboarding an employee uh we say you know thanks for that answer it's completely wrong um and and uh and then we present to them uh this is what a CTL is okay and so this is what a CTL is at Nvidia and the CTL as you can see you know CTL stands for compute Trace Library which makes sense you know we were tracing compute Cycles all the time and it wrote the program isn't that amazing and so the productivity of our chip designers can go up this is what you can do with a Nim first thing you can do with is customize it we have a service called Nemo microservice that helps you curate the data preparing the data so that you could teach this on board this AI you fine-tune them and then you guardrail it you can even evaluate the answer evaluate its performance against um other other examples and so that's called the Nemo micr service now the thing that's that's emerging here is this there are three elements three pillars of what we're doing the first pillar is of course inventing the technology for um uh AI models and running AI models and packaging it up for you the second is to create tools to help you modify it first is having the AI technology second is to help you modify it and third is infrastructure for you to fine-tune it and if you like deploy it you could deploy it on our infrastructure called dgx cloud or you can employ deploy it on Prem you can deploy it anywhere you like once you develop it it's yours to take anywhere and so we are effectively an AI Foundry we will do for you and the industry on AI what tsmc does for us building chips and so we go to it with our go to tsmc with our big Ideas they manufacture and we take it with us and so exactly the same thing here AI Foundry and the three pillar ERS are the NIMS Nemo microservice and dgx Cloud the other thing that you could teach the Nim to do is to understand your proprietary information remember inside our company the vast majority of our data is not in the cloud it's inside our company it's been sitting there you know being used all the time and and gosh it's it's basically invidious intelligence we would like to take that data learn its meaning like we learned the meaning of almost anything else that we just talked about learn its meaning and then reindex that knowledge into a new type of database called a vector database and so you essentially take structured data or unstructured data you learn its meaning you encode its meaning so now this becomes an AI database and that AI database in the future once you create it you can talk to it and so let me give you an example of what you could do so suppose you create you get you got a whole bunch of multi modality data and one good example of that is PDF so you take the PDF you take all of your PDFs all the all your favorite you know the stuff that that is proprietary to you critical to your company you can encode it just as we encoded pixels of a cat and it becomes the word cat we can encode all of your PDF and it turns into vectors that are now stored inside your vector database it becomes the proprietary information of your company and once you have that proprietary information you can chat to it it's an it's a smart database and so you just ch chat with data and how how much more enjoyable is that you know we for for our software team you know they just chat with the bugs database you know how many bugs was there last night um are we making any progress and then after you're done talking to this uh bugs database you need therapy and so so we have another chatbot for you you can do it okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the reason for that is because ultimately it's job is to go retrieve information as quickly as possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve me this information it goes if brings it back to you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay and so we call it the Nemo retriever well the Nemo service helps you create all these things and we have all all these different Nims we even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel your AI care manager okay so so it's a really short clip but there were so many videos to show you I guess so many other demos to show you and so I I had to cut this one short but this is Diana she is a digital human Nim and and uh you just talked to her and she's connected in this case to Hippocratic ai's large language model for healthcare and it's truly amazing she is just super smart about Healthcare things you know and so after you're done after my my Dwight my VP of software engineering talks to the chatbot for bugs database then you come over here and talk to Diane and and so so uh Diane is is um completely animated with AI and she's a digital human uh there's so many companies that would like to build they're sitting on gold mines the the Enterprise IT industry is sitting on a gold mine it's a gold mine because they have so much understanding of of uh the way work is done they have all these amazing tools that have been created over the years and they're sitting on a lot of data if they could take that gold mine and turn them into co-pilots these co-pilots could help us do things and so just about every it franchise it platform in the world that has valuable tools that people use is sitting on a gold mine for co-pilots and they would like to build their own co-pilots and their own chatbots and so we're announcing that Nvidia AI foundary is working with some of the world's great companies sap generates 87% of the world's Global Commerce basically the world runs on sap we run on sap Nvidia and sap are building sap Jewel co-pilots uh using Nvidia Nemo and dgx cloud service now they run 80 85% of the world's Fortune 500 companies run their people and customer service operations on service now and they're using Nvidia AI Foundry to build service now uh assist virtual assistance cohesity backs up the world's data they're sitting on a gold mine of data hundreds of exobytes of data over 10,000 companies Nvidia AI Foundry is working with them helping them build their Gaia generative AI agent snowflake is a company that stores the world's uh digital Warehouse in the cloud and serves over 3 billion queries a day for 10,000 Enterprise customers snowflake is working with Nvidia AI Foundry to build co-pilots with Nvidia Nemo and Nims net apppp nearly half of the files in the world are stored on Prem on net apppp Nvidia AI Foundry is helping them uh build chat Bots and co-pilots like those Vector databases and retrievers with Nvidia neemo and Nims and we have a great partnership with Dell everybody who everybody who is building these chat Bots and generative AI when you're ready to run it you're going to need an AI Factory and nobody is better at Building end-to-end Systems of very large scale for the Enterprise than Dell and so anybody any company every company will need to build AI factories and it turns out that Michael is here he's happy to take your order ladies and gentlemen Michael del okay let's talk about the next wave of Robotics the next wave of AI robotics physical AI so far all of the AI that we've talked about is one computer data comes into one computer lots of the world's if you will experience in digital text form the AI imitates Us by reading a lot of the language to predict the next words it's imitating You by studying all of the patterns and all the other previous examples of course it has to understand context and so on so forth but once it understands the context it's essentially imitating you we take all of the data we put it into a system like dgx we compress it into a large language model trillions and trillions of parameters become billions and billion trillions of tokens becomes billions of parameters these billions of parameters becomes your AI well in order for us to go to the next wave of AI where the AI understands the physical world we're going to need three computers the first computer is still the same computer it's that AI computer that now is going to be watching video and maybe it's doing synthetic data generation and maybe there's a lot of human examples just as we have human examples in text form we're going to have human examples in articulation form and the AIS will watch us understand what is happening and try to adapt it for themselves into the context and because it can generalize with these Foundation models maybe these robots can also perform in the physical world fairly generally so I just described in very simple terms essentially what just happened in large language models except the chat GPT moment for robotics may be right around the corner and so we've been building the end to-end systems for robotics for some time I'm super super proud of the work we have the AI system dgx we have the lower system which is called agx for autonomous systems the world's first robotics processor when we first built this thing people are what are you guys building it's a s so it's one chip it's designed to be very low power but it's designed for high-speed sensor processing and Ai and so if you want to run Transformers in a car or you want to run Transformers in a in a you know anything um that moves uh we have the perfect computer for you it's called the Jetson and so the dgx on top for training the AI the Jetson is the autonomous processor and in the middle we need another computer whereas large language models have the benefit of you providing your examples and then doing reinforcement learning human feedback what is the reinforcement learning human feedback of a robot well it's reinforcement learning physical feedback that's how you align the robot that's how you that's how the robot knows that as it's learning these articulation capabilities and manipulation capabilities it's going to adapt properly into the laws of physics and so we need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot we call that virtual world Omniverse and the computer that runs Omniverse is called ovx and ovx the computer itself is hosted in the Azure Cloud okay and so basically we built these three things these three systems on top of it we have algorithms for every single one now I'm going to show you one super example of how Ai and Omniverse are going to work together the example I'm going to show you is kind of insane but it's going to be very very close to tomorrow it's a robotics building this robotics building is called a warehouse inside the robotics building are going to be some autonomous systems some of the autonomous systems are going to be called humans and some of the autonomous systems are going to be called forklifts and these autonomous systems are going to interact with each other of course autonomously and it's going to be overlooked upon by this Warehouse to keep everybody out of Harm's Way the warehouse is essentially an air traffic controller and whenever it sees something happening it will redirect traffic traffic and give New Way points just new way points to the robots and the people and they'll know exactly what to do this warehouse this building you can also talk to of course you could talk to it hey you know sap Center how are you feeling today for example and so you could ask the same the warehouse the same questions basically the system I just described will have Omniverse Cloud that's hosting the virtual simulation and AI running on djx cloud and all of this is running in real time let's take a look the future of heavy industri starts as a digital twin the AI agents helping robots workers and infrastructure navigate unpredictable events in complex industrial spaces will be built and evaluated first in sophisticated digital twins this Omniverse digital twin of a 100,000 ft Warehouse is operating as a simulation environment that integrates digital workers amrs running the Nvidia Isaac receptor stack centralized activity maps of the entire Warehouse from 100 simulated ceiling mount cameras using Nvidia metropolis and AMR route planning with Nvidia Koop software in Loop testing of AI agents in this physically accurate simulated environment enables us to evaluate and refine how the system adapts to real world unpredictability here an incident occurs along this amr's planned route blocking its path as it moves to pick up a pallet Nvidia Metropolis updates and sends a realtime occupancy map to kopt where a new optimal route is calculated the AMR is enabled to see around corners and improve its Mission efficiency with generative AI powered Metropolis Vision Foundation models operators can even ask questions using natural language the visual model understands nuanced activity and can offer immediate insights to improve operations all of the sensor data is created in simulation and passed to the real-time AI running as Nvidia inference microservices or Nims and when the AI is ready to be deployed in the physical twin the real Warehouse we connect metropolis and Isaac Nims to real sensors with the ability for continuous Improvement of both the digital twin and the AI models isn't that incredible and so remember remember a future facility Warehouse Factory building will be software defined and so the software is running how else would you test the software so you you you test the software to building the warehouse the optimization system in the digital twin what about all the robots all of those robots you are seeing just now they're all running their own autonomous robotic stack and so the way you integrate software in the future cicd in the future for robotic systems is with digital twins we've made Omniverse a lot easier to access we're going to create basically Omniverse Cloud apis four simple API and a channel and you can connect your application to it so this is this is going to be as wonderfully beautifully simple in the future that Omniverse is going to be and with these apis you're going to have these magical digital twin capability we also have turned om ver into an AI and integrated it with the ability to chat USD the the language of our language is you know human and Omniverse is language as it turns out is universal scene description and so that language is rather complex and so we've taught our Omniverse uh that language and so you can speak to it in English and it would directly generate USD and it would talk back in USD but Converse back to you in English you could also look for information in this world semantically instead of the world being encoded semantically in in language now it's encoded semantically in scenes and so you could ask it of of uh certain objects or certain conditions and certain scenarios and it can go and find that scenario for you it also can collaborate with you in generation you could design some things in 3D it could simulate some things in 3D or you could use AI to generate something in 3D let's take a look at how this is all going to work we have a great partnership with Seamans Seamans is the world's largest industrial engineering and operations platform you've seen now so many different companies in the industrial space heavy Industries is one of the greatest final frontiers of it and we finally now have the Necessary Technology to go and make a real impact seens is building the industrial metaverse and today we're announcing that Seamans is connecting their Crown Jewel accelerator to Nvidia Omniverse let's take a look seens technology is transformed every day for everyone team Center acts our leading product life cycle management software from the sems accelerator platform is used every day by our customers to develop and deliver products at scale now we are bringing the real and the digital worlds even Closer by integrating Nvidia Ai and Omniverse Technologies into team Center X Omniverse apis enable data interoperability and physics-based rendering to Industrial scale design and Manufacturing projects our customers HD market leader in sustainable ship manufacturing builds ammonia and hydrogen power chips often comprising over 7 million discrete Parts with Omniverse apis team Center X lets companies like HD yundai unify and visualize these massive engineering data sets interactively and integrate generative AI to generate 3D objects or HDR I backgrounds to see their projects in context the result an ultra inuitive photoal physics-based digital twin that eliminates waste and errors delivering huge savings in cost and time and we are building this for collaboration whether across more semens accelerator tools like seens anex or Star CCM Plus or across teams working on their favorite devices in the same scene together in this is just the beginning working with Nvidia we will bring accelerated Computing generative Ai and Omniverse integration across the Sean accelerator portfolio the pro the the professional the professional voice actor happens to be a good friend of mine Roland Bush who happens to be the CEO of seens once you get Omniverse connected into your workflow your ecosystem from the beginning of your design to engineering to manufacturing planning all the way to digital twin operations once you connect everything together it's insane how much productivity you can get and it's just really really wonderful all of a sudden everybody is operating on the same ground truth you don't have to exchange data and convert data make mistakes everybody is working on the same ground truth from the design Department to the art Department the architecture Department all the way to the engineering and even the marketing department let's take a look at how Nissan has integrated Omniverse into their workflow and it's all because it's connected by all these wonderful tools and these developers that we're working with take a look unbel for for that was not an animation that was Omniverse today we're announcing that Omniverse Cloud streams to The Vision Pro and it is very very strange that you walk around virtual doors when I was getting out of that car and everybody does it it is really really quite amazing Vision Pro connected to Omniverse portals you into Omniverse and because all of these CAD tools and all these different design tools are now integrated and connected to Omniverse you can have this type of workflow really incredible let's talk about robotics everything that moves will be robotic there's no question about that it's safer it's more convenient and one of the largest Industries is going to be Automotive we build the robotic stack from top to bottom as I was mentioned from the computer system but in the case of self-driving cars including the self-driving application at the end of this year or I guess beginning of next year we will be shipping in Mercedes and then shortly after that jlr and so these autonomous robotic systems are software defined they take a lot of work to do has computer vision has obviously artificial intelligence control and planning all kinds of very complicated technology and takes years to refine we're building the entire stack however we open up our entire stack for all of the automotive industry this is just the way we work the way we work in every single industry we try to build as much of it as we can so that we understand it but then we open it up so everybody can access it whether you would like to buy just our computer which is the world's only full functional save asld system that can run AI this functional safe asld quality computer or the operating system on top or of course our data centers which is in basically every AV company in the world however you would like to enjoy it we're delighted by it today we're announcing that byd the world's largest ev company is adopting our next Generation it's called Thor Thor is designed for Transformer engines Thor our next Generation AV computer will be used by byd you probably don't know this fact that we have over a million robotics developers we created Jetson this robotics computer we're so proud of it the amount of software that goes on top of it is insane but the reason why we can do it at all is because it's 100% Cuda compatible everything that we do everything that we do in our company is in service of our developers and by us being able to maintain this Rich ecosystem and make it compatible with everything that you access from us we can bring all of that incredible capability to this little tiny computer we call Jetson a robotics computer we also today are announcing this incredibly Advanced new SDK we call it Isaac perceptor Isaac perceptor most most of the Bots today are pre-programmed they're either following rails on the ground digital rails or theyd be following April tags but in the future they're going to have perception and the reason why you want that is so that you could easily program it you say would you like to go from point A to point B and it will figure out a way to navigate its way there so by only programming waypoints the entire route could be adaptive the entire environment could be reprogrammed just as I showed you at the very beginning with the warehouse you can't do that with pre-programmed agvs if those boxes fall down they just all gum up and they just wait there for somebody to come clear it and so now with the Isaac perceptor we have incredible state-of-the-art Vision odometry 3D reconstruction and in addition to 3D reconstruction depth perception the reason for that is so that you can have two modalities to keep an eye on what's happening in the world Isaac perceptor the most used robot today is the manipulator manufacturing arms and they are also pre-programmed the computer vision algorithms the AI algorithms the control and path planning algorithms that are geometry aware incredibly computational intensive we have made these Cuda accelerated so we have the world's first Cuda accelerated motion planner that is geometry aware you put something in front of it it comes up with a new plan and our articulates around it it has excellent perception for pose estimation of a 3D object not just not it's pose in 2D but it's pose in 3D so it has to imagine what's around and how best to grab it so the foundation pose the grip foundation and the um articulation algorithms are now available we call it Isaac manipulator and they also uh just run on nvidia's computers we are are starting to do some really great work in the next generation of Robotics the next generation of Robotics will likely be a humanoid robotics we now have the Necessary Technology and as I was describing earlier the Necessary Technology to imagine generalized human robotics in a way human robotics is likely easier and the reason for that is because we have a lot more imitation training data that we can provide there robots because we are constructed in a very similar way it is very likely that the human robotics will be much more useful in our world because we created the world to be something that we can interoperate in and work well in and the way that we set up our workstations and Manufacturing and Logistics they were designed for for humans they were designed for people and so these human robotics will likely be much more productive to deploy while we're creating just like we're doing with the others the entire stack starting from the top a foundation model that learns from watching video human IM human examples it could be in video form it could be in virtual reality form we then created a gym for it called Isaac reinforcement learning gym which allows the humanoid robot to learn how to adapt to the physical world and then an incredible computer the same computer that's going to go into a robotic car this computer will run inside a human or robot called Thor it's designed for Transformer engines we've combined several of these into one video this is something that you're going to really love take a look it's not enough for humans to imagine we have to invent and explore real and push Beyond what's been done fair amount of detail we create smarter and faster we push it to fail so it can learn we teach it then help it teach itself we broaden its understanding to take on new challenges with absolute precision and succeed we make it perceive and move and even reason so it can share our world with us this is where inspiration leads us the next Frontier this is Nvidia Project Groot a general purpose Foundation model for humanoid robot learning the group model takes multimodal instructions and past interactions as input and produces the next action for the robot to execute we developed Isaac lab a robot learning application to train gr on Omniverse Isaac Sim and we scale out with osmo a new compute orchestration service that coordinates work flows across dgx systems for training and ovx systems for simulation with these tools we can train Groot in physically based simulation and transfer zero shot to the real world the Groot model will enable a robot to learn from a handful of human demonstrations so it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us this is made possible with nvidia's technologies that can understand humans from videos train models and simulation and ultimately deploy them directly to physical robots connecting group to a large language model even allows it to generate motions by following natural language instructions hi go1 can you give me a high five sure thing let's high five can you give us some cool moves sure check this out all this incredible intelligence is powered by the new Jetson Thor robotics chips designed for Groot built for the future with Isaac lab osmo and Groot we're providing the building blocks for the next generation of AI powered robotics about the same size the soul of Nvidia the intersection of computer Graphics physics artificial intelligence it all came to bear at this moment the name of that project general robotics 003 I know super good super good well I think we have some special guests do we hey guys so I understand you guys are powered by Jetson they're powered by Jetson little Jetson robotics computers inside they learn to walk in Isaac Sim ladies and gentlemen this this is orange and this is the famous green they are the bdx robots of Disney amazing Disney research come on you guys let's wrap up let's go five things where you going I sit right here Don't Be Afraid come here green hurry up what are you saying no it's not time to eat it's not time to I'll I'll give you a snack in a moment let me finish up real quick come on green hurry up stop wasting time five things five things first a new Industrial Revolution every data center should be accelerated a trillion dollars worth of installed data centers will become modernized over the next several years second because of the computational capability we brought to bear a new way of doing software has emerged generative AI which is going to create new in new infrastructure dedicated to doing one thing and one thing only not for multi-user data centers but AI generators these AI generation will create incredibly valuable software a new Industrial Revolution second the computer of this revolution the computer of this generation generative AI trillion parameters blackw insane amounts of computers and computing third I'm trying to concentrate good job third new computer new computer creates new types of software new type of software should be distributed in a new way so that it can on the one hand be an endpoint in the cloud and easy to use but still allow you to take it with you because it is your intelligence your intelligence should be pack packaged up in a way that allows you to take it with you we call them Nims and third these Nims are going to help you create a new type of application for the future not one that you wrote completely from scratch but you're going to integrate them like teams create these applications we have a fantastic capability between Nims the AI technology the tools Nemo and the infrastructure dgx cloud in our AI Foundry to help you create proprietary applications proprietary chat Bots and then lastly everything that moves in the future will be robotic you're not going to be the only one and these robotic systems whether they are humanoid amrs self-driving cars forklifts manipulating arms they will all need one thing Giant stadiums warehouses factories there can to be factories that are robotic orchestrating factories uh manufacturing lines that are robotics building cars that are robotics these systems all need one thing they need a platform a digital platform a digital twin platform and we call that Omniverse the operating system of the robotics World these are the five things that we talked about today what does Nvidia look like what does Nvidia look like when we talk about gpus there's a very different image that I have when I when people ask me about gpus first I see a bunch of software stacks and things like that and second I see this this is what we announce to you today this is Blackwell this is the plat amazing amazing processors MV link switches networking systems and the system design is a miracle this is Blackwell and this to me is what a GPU looks like in my mind listen orange green I think we have one more treat for everybody what do you think should we okay we have one more thing to show you roll it he m yeah thank you thank you have a great have a great GTC thank you all for coming thank you Build me car on an empty road. Hello, I'm James, a digital human. Feel free to ask me anything about NVIDIAand its products. Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats and welcome to the stage, NVIDIA Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. Hello, Japan! Hello, Japan. Welcome to NVIDIA AI Summit. Everything you saw just now was simulated. Everything was simulation. No animation. At the core, NVIDIA is asimulation technology company. We simulate physics. We simulate virtual worlds, we simulate intelligence. Through our simulations, we help you predict the future. So in many ways, NVIDIA builds time machines. Today we're going to talk to youabout some of our latest breakthroughs. But most importantly, this is an eventabout the Japan ecosystem. We have so many partners here. 350 startups, 250,000 developers, hundreds of companies. We've been cominghere for a very long time. Japan has been very dear to ussince the very early foundings of our company. It is here in Japan we did many firsts,many firsts for NVIDIA. It was our first game developerthat worked with us. SEGA, Yu Suzuki, the famous developer, 3D game developer,who first worked with us to port SEGA's incredible3D games to NVIDIA's GPUs. It was the first time that someone used NVIDIA CUDAto build a supercomputer. The Tsubame 1.2 at Tokyo Tech, which enabled NVIDIAto utilize our GPUs to advance scientific computing. Japan has been first in so many ways. It was also the first time thatwe were able to create mobile processors, which led to one of our very, very dear projects,the Nintendo Switch. So many firsts. Now we're in the beginning of a new age. The AI revolution: a new industry,extraordinary technology changes. This is a time that is very exciting,but it's also very critical. So we're here to partnerwith the Japan ecosystem, the amazing companies here,to bring AI to Japan. So that we can all together take advantage of thisextraordinary opportunity ahead of us. We have many partners here todaythat I would like to thank GMO Internet Group,Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, MITSUI and Companyare the platinum sponsors. I want to thank all of you for that. Thank you. And 56 other sponsors. Thank you all for comingand thank you for supporting us. NVIDIA invented accelerated computing. Accelerated computing does not replace the CPU. In fact, we were just about the only companyin computing who did not want to replace the CPU,but to augment the CPU, so that we can take the workloadsthat are very computationally intensive and offload them onto the GPU. These are GPUs, that's the CPU. Working together, we can take advantage of the bestcapabilities of both processors, one that is extremely good atsequential processing, the CPU, and a processor that's incredibly goodat parallel processing, called the GPU. This I'll talk about in just a second. But this is accelerated computing. Not just parallel computing,but accelerated computing. CPU and GPU working together. This computing model is brand new to the world. In fact, just using the CPU has been around since 1964,the year after my birth. 60 years in the making. The vast majority of everything we see in the world todayrunning on computers are running on CPUs. But there's a new change, a fundamentalchange in the computing model. But in order to do that,you cannot just take the CPU software that's running sequentiallyand put it on a GPU to run parallel. We have to create a whole bunch of newalgorithms. Just as OpenGL made it possible for computergraphics applications to connect to accelerationthrough the graphics processor, we had to create many domain-specific libraries like OpenGL,but for many different applications. These are some of the 350 different libraries we have in our company,some very, very important libraries. CuLitho was for computational lithography,takes computational lithography. Making the mask of chips may require many, many weeksbecause there are so many layers. We take many weeks of computationand reduce it down to hours. We could, of course,speed up the cycle time of building chips, but very importantly,we also make it possible to advance the algorithms of lithographymuch, much more sophisticated so that we canadvance semiconductor physics well beyond two nanometers,one nanometer and beyond. So computational lithographyis going to be accelerated by cuLitho. CuDSS for Sparse Solver, AI Aerial— I'll talk about that today. An incredible new library that makes it possiblefor this computer to run the 5G radio stack. Basically a radio in real timerunning on the CUDA accelerator. CUDA-Q for quantum simulation, quantumcircuit simulations, Parabricks for gene sequencing, cuVS for vector storage,or vector databases for indexing and queryingvector databases that is used for AI. CuPyNumeric is a numerical processing library. NumPy is the most popularnumerical processing library in the world. Five million different developers use it. It has been downloaded 30 million timesjust last month. Incredible number of downloads. It is now fully accelerated for multi-GPUmulti-node. CuPyNumeric, please go look it up.It's incredible. CuDF for data frame processing, structured data processinglike SQL, Pandas, Polars. CuOPT, the classic incredibly complicatedtraveling salesperson problem. This problem has now been acceleratedfor CuOPT, hundreds of times faster. Modulus for AI physics, and then one of the most importantlibraries we ever created, called cuDNN. CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes the different layers, the various layersof the deep learning stack. It enabled usto do something extraordinary. By creating cuDNN, and acceleratingand democratizing deep learning, we made it possible in the last decade to scale artificial intelligence and scale machine learning by 1 million times. Increasing the scale of machine learningby 1 million times enabled, of course, the incredible breakthroughthat we now know—ChatGPT. The advent of artificial intelligence. CuDNN did something very special. It enabled a change in the way that software is done. This is the way that software was donebefore. Software 1.0. Software programmers writing code to describe an algorithm—that's a function. That function is software. You then apply input, it predicts an output. That code written by human runsbest on CPUs. Software 1.0 was coding, writing software that runs on CPUs. Software 2.0, because the computer is now so incredibly fast, you can give it an enormous amount of examples—observed data— so that it can learn, it can predictwhat the function is by itself. We call that software 2.0. So instead of coding,it is now machine learning. Instead of code running on CPU,it is now neural networks running on GPUs. And neural networks, these neural networksthat are running on GPUs is now the formation of a new operating system, a new way of using computers. The operating system of the moderncomputer, Large Language Models. This machine learning approach has proven to be incredibly scalable. You can use it for all kinds of things. Of course, digitized text, languages, of course, digitized sound,speech, images, video. It could be multimodal. You could teach it amino acid sequences. You could teach it to understandjust about anything, anything where you have large observed data. Well, that was the first step, was to understandthe meaning of the data. Just by studying an enormousamount of text on the internet, we were able to understand the words, the vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and even the meaning of the words. by finding patterns and relationships. Using the same approach, we're now able to not only understand the meaningof the different data types, connect it to different modalities—for example words and images. Connect the image of the word 'cat' and the image of a catare now connected together, learning a multi-modality. We can now even translate and generate, so we can understand data of all kinds, and we can generate intelligent information,intelligence of all kinds. Well, if you look at all the amazing startupsthat are being created and the amazing applications that are being created,you can find it in this slide in one of the two combinations. One side to the other side, Text to text, would be summarization, question and answering, text generation, storytelling. Video to text wouldbe captioning. Image to text—image recognition. Text to images— image generation like Midjourney. Text to video—video creationlike Runway ML. All of these different combinationsare truly breakthrough. You can even have proteins to text, explain what a protein does. Text to chemicals,describe properties of a chemical that might be a successful drugfor drug discovery. You can even have video and textto machine articulation, robotics. Each one of these combinations is a new industry,new company, new application use case, incredible Cambrian explosionof the number of applications have now been created. And we're just at the beginning. One of the properties of machine learning,of course, is that the larger the brain, the more data we can teach it, the smarter it becomes. We call it the scaling law. There's every evidence that as we scale up the size of the models,the amount of training data, the effectiveness, the quality, the performanceof the intelligence improves. Every single year, the industry is scaling upthe size of the models by 2X or so, which correspondingly need 2X the data, and therefore we need 4Xthe amount of compute. The amount of computing resource necessaryto drive to the next level of artificial intelligenceis extraordinary. We call that the scaling law, the training scaling law. Pre-training is part of it, post-training is part of it. Post-training with reinforcementlearning, human feedback, reinforcement learning, AI feedback. So many different ways now of using synthetic data generationin the post-training stage. So training, pre-training,post-training is enjoying very significant scaling and we're continuingto see excellent results. Well, when Strawberry orOpenAI’s o1 was announced, it exposed the worldto a new type of inference. Inference is when you interact with the AI, just like ChatGPT. But ChatGPT is one shot. You ask it a question,you ask it to do something for you. Whatever question you have, whatever prompts you provide, through one shot,it delivers an answer. However, we know that thinking is oftentimesmore than just one shot, and thinking requires us to maybe domulti-plans, multiple potential answersthat we choose the best one from. Just like when we're thinking. We might reflect on the answerbefore we deliver the answer. Reflection. We might take a problem and break it down into step by stepby step, chain of thought. There are many different technologiesthat we've invented that makes it possible for inference to perform better and better as we apply more and more compute. Now we have the second scaling law: inference scaling law. Not just generation of the next word,but thinking, reflecting, planning. These two simultaneous scale lawsare going to require us to drive computing at extraordinary speeds. Every single time when we deliver a new generation,a new architecture, we increase the performance by X factors, but we also decrease the powerby the same X factor. We decrease the cost by the same X factor. So driving up performance is exactlythe same as reducing cost. Driving up the performance is exactlythe same as reducing energy. And so therefore as the world continuesto absorb and embrace artificial intelligence, it is our mission, it is our duty, it is our duty, to continue to drive theperformance up as fast as we can. In the process, expanding the reach of artificial intelligence,driving up its effectiveness, driving down its cost,driving down its power consumption. That's the reasonwhy we went to a one year cycle. However, AI is not a chip problem. These AI systems are enormous. This is the Blackwell system. Blackwell is the name of a GPU, but it'salso the name of this entire system. The GPU is extraordinary in itself. There are two Blackwell dies. Each Blackwell die is the largest chipthe world's ever made. 104 billion transistors made by TSMC and their mostadvanced four nanometer node. Two of these Blackwell dies are connected togetheracross 10TB/s, low energy link. Right in the middle,right there, that line, that seam. Thousands of interconnections between the two dies.Ten terabytes per second. It's connected by eight HBM3E memories from SK Hynixand from Micron. And these memories togetherrun at 8 TB/s. And 8 TB/s, these two GPUs are connected to the CPU with another low, very low energy, very energy efficient series, 1 TB/s. Each one of the GPUs are connectedthrough NVLink at 1.8 TB/s. That's a lot of terabytes per second. And the reason for thatis because this system cannot work alone. Even the most advanced computerthe world has ever made cannot work alonefor artificial intelligence. Sometimes it has to work with thousandsof other computers like this, nodes like this, together as one computer,and sometimes they have to work separately because they are respondingto a different customer, different query. So sometimes separately,sometimes as one. In order to enable the GPUs to work as one,we of course have networking, two ConnectX-7s that connect this GPU with thousands of other GPUs, but we still need this NVLink. This NVLink allows us to connect the few GPUs in one rackthat's standing behind me. That one rack behind me,that one rack is connected to, with this NVLink 5.0, 1.8TB per second, 35 times higher bandwidth than the highestbandwidth networking in the world, which allows us to connectall of these GPUs together to this NVLink switch. There are nine NVLink switches in one rack. Each rack has 72 computers like this connected through this spine. This is the NVLink spine. This is cables, copper. 50 pounds of copper, driven directly by this incredible series, incredible IO we call NVLink. They connect into, connect into the computer, into NVLink this way, and this switch connects all of these computers together as one. And so what results, are 72 of these computers connected as one large GPU. One incredibly large GPU. From the software perspective,it is just one giant chip, and these racks, these NVLinked 72 systems. This one rack. This one rack is 3,000 pounds. It is impossible to put on this stageotherwise I'd show it to you. That is 3,000 pounds and 120kW. That is, I have my my friends here. That's many, many Nintendo Switch power. It is not portable but it's very powerful. And so this is the Blackwell system. We designed this so that it can beconfigured as one superpod like this, or one entire gigantic data center with thousands and thousands of them,hopefully hundreds of thousands of them, And they're connected to themby the switches. Some of them are Quantum InfiniBand switches. If you want to have a dedicated AI factoryor a Spectrum-X, NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionary ethernet system that you can integrate into your existing ethernet environments. We can build AI supercomputers with these, we can integrate them into enterprisedata centers, into hyperscalers, or configure them for the edge. The Blackwell systemis not only incredibly powerful, it is also incredibly adaptable,so that it can fit into every corner of the world'scomputing infrastructure. So this is this is Blackwell. On top of Blackwell,of course, is the computer. But most importantly,without all of the software that runs on top of it, this computer is justsimply impossible to operate. When you see these computerswith all of the liquid cooling, all of the wiring,the mind will blow up. How do you programsuch an incredible computer? This is where NVIDIA's software stack,this is where all of our effort in CUDA, NCCL, all of our Megatron, Megatron-Core, all of the software that we created,TensorRT LLM, Triton, all of the software that we created overthe years integrated into the system,makes it possible for everyone, anyone, to deployAI supercomputers around the world. And then, of course, on top we have AI softwarethat makes it easy for people to build AI. And so what is AI? What is AI? We talk about AIin a lot of different ways, but I think there are two types of AIsthat will be extremely popular. And there are two mental modelsthat I think are very helpful. It's very helpful to me. The first AI is basically a digital AI worker. These AI workers can understand, they can plan and they can take action. Sometimes the digital AI workers are being asked to execute a marketing campaign, support a customer, come up with a manufacturing supplychain plan, optimize a chip, help us write software. Maybe be a research assistant, a lab assistant in the drug discovery industry. Maybe this agent you know is a tutor to the CEO. Maybe there's a tutorfor all of our employees. These AI, these digital AI workers,we call them AI agents are essentially like digital employees. And just like digital employees,you have to train them. You have to create datato welcome them to your company, teach them about your company. You train them for their particular skills, depending on what functionyou would like them to have, you evaluate themafter you're done training them to make sure that they learnedwhat they're supposed to learn, you guardrail themto make sure that they perform the job they're asked to do, and not the jobsthey're not asked to do. And of course, you operate them, you deploy them. Provide them energy from Blackwell, the AI tokens from Blackwell. And they interact with other agentsto work as a team to solve problems. Well, you're goingto see all kinds of different agents. And we created several thingsto make it easier for the ecosystem to be ableto build AI agents for companies. NVIDIA is not in the service business. And we don't create, we don't deliverfinal product, we don't deliver solutions, but we do deliver the enabling technologyto make it possible for the ecosystem to create AI, to deliver AI, to continuously improve AI. The AI agent lifecycle libraries, the lifecycle platform is called NeMo, and NeMo has libraries for each one of the stages that I mentioned,from data curation to training, to fine tuning to synthetic data generationto evaluation, to guard railing. And these libraries are integrated into workflowsand frameworks all over the world. We're working with AI startups, service providerslike Accenture and Deloitte, companies all over the world to bring thisto all of the large companies. We also work with ISVs like ServiceNow so that they can create agentsthat use ServiceNow. Today, you use ServiceNowby licensing the platform and your employees interact with the ServiceNow platformto get assistance. In the future, ServiceNow will also provide a large number of AI agentsthat you can rent. Essentially digital employees that you canrent to help you solve problems. We're working with ServiceNow,we're working with SAP, Cadence, Ansys, companiesall over the world, Snowflake, companies all over the worldso that we can all build agents that can be helpful to youin driving productivity in your company. Now, these agents are able to understand, reason, plan, take action. And these agents are collections or systems of AI models. It's not just one AI model, but a system of AI models. And NeMo helps us build those. We also create pre-trained AI models that we package up inwhat is called a NIM. And so these NIMs are microservices. They're basically AI packaged. In the old days,software was packaged in a box and they'd come delivered with CD-ROMs. Today, AI is packaged in a microservice andinside the software is smart. You could talk to the softwareand you could talk to the software because it understands what you mean,and you can connect the software with other software. You can connect thisAI with other AI, and together you could createessentially an agent, an AI agent. So this is the first thing. Let me give youan example of some of these agents. Agenetic AI is transforming every enterprise using sophisticatedreasoning and iterative planning to solve complex,multi-step problems. AI agents help marketing campaigns go live faster with instant insights,helping optimize supply chain operations, saving hundreds of millions in costs,and reduce software security processes from days to seconds by helping analyststriage vulnerabilities. What makes agenticAI so powerful is its ability to turn data into knowledge,and knowledge into action. A digital agent in this examplecan educate individuals with insights from a set of informationally denseresearch papers. It was built using NVIDIA AI Blueprints. These are reference workflowsfeaturing NVIDIA acceleration libraries, SDKs, and NIM microservices that help you rapidly buildand deploy AI apps. The multi-modal PDF Data ExtractionBlueprint helps build a data ingest pipeline,while the Digital Human Blueprint provides smooth, human-like interactions. “Hi, I’m James.� A digital agent ingests PDF researchpapers, including complex data like images, chartsand tables, and generates a high level summary delivered throughan interactive digital human interface. “What an exciting breakthrough in weatherforecasting. The development of CorrDiff,a new generative model, is a significant step forwardin accurately predicting weather patterns by combining a U-Net regression modelwith a diffusion model.� James can also answer questions or generate new contentbased on the papers. NVIDIA AI gives enterprisesthe power to automate processes, tap into real timeinsights, and enhance workflow efficiency. AI agents. Three parts: NeMo, NIMs, and Blueprints. These are all references. They're available to you in source formso that you could use it as you like and build your AI agent workforce. None of these agents can do 100% of anyone's task. Anybody's job. None of the agents can do 100%. However, all of the agents will be able to do work for 50% of your work. This is the great achievement. Instead of thinking about AI as replacingthe work of 50% of the people, you should think that AI will do50% of the work for 100% of the people. By thinking that way,you realize that AI will help boost your company'sproductivity, boost your productivity. You know, people have asked me,you know, is AI going to take your job? And I always say, because it's true, AI will not take your job. AI used by somebody else, will take your job. And so be sure to activateusing AI as soon as you can. So the first is digital AI agents. Digital. These are digital AIs. The second application is physical AI. The same basic technology is now embodied, sits inside a mechanical system. Of course, robotics is going to be one of the most importantindustries in the world. Until now, robotics has been limited and the reason is very, very clear. In fact, here in Japan, 50% of the world'smanufacturing robots are built. Kawasaki, FANUC, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi. Four of the leaders that buildhalf of the world's robotic systems. As much as robots have driven the productivity of manufacturing,it has been very difficult to expand. The robotics industryhas been largely flat for a long time. And the reason for thatis because it is too specific. It is not flexible enough. It is not flexible enoughto be able to apply to different scenarios and different conditionsand different work. We need AI that is much, much more flexible,that it can adapt and learn by itself. Notice the technology that we described upuntil now, agentic AI. Irrespective of who you are, you should beable to interact with the agents. It can give you response. Of course, sometimes the response is not as goodas the response that you would produce, but many of them are in facteven better than what we can produce. And so we can now apply this generalAI technology into the world of embodied AI or physical AI,or otherwise known as robotics. In order to enable robotics to happen,we need to build three computers. The first computer is training the AI, just like we did with all of the examplesI've given you so far. Second is to simulate the AI, you need to give theAI a place to practice, a place to learn, a place to retreat, to receive synthetic datathat it can learn from. We call that Omniverse. Omniverse is our virtual worlddigital twin suite of libraries that could be used for creating physical AIs, robotics. Omniverse, then, after validation,after training, after evaluation, then you can take the modeland put it into a physical robot. Inside that we have processorsthat are designed for robotics. We call it Jetson Thor. Thor is a robotics processordesigned for humanoid robots. This loop goes on and on and on. Just as there is a NeMo AI agent life cycle platform, there is this Omniverse platform that enables you to create AI. Well, ultimately, what you want is the AI—notice on the left—it sees a world, tt sees the video,it sees the surrounding, the circumstance. You tell it what you want. And this AI will generate articulation motion. Just as we take text,we can generate video, we can take textand generate chemicals for drugs. We can take text and generate articulation motion. So this concept is very similarto generative AI. And this is the reason why we think that now we have the necessary technologybetween Omniverse and all the computersthat we built, these three computers and the latest generative AI technology, that the time has come for humanoid robotics. Now, why is humanoid robotics so hard? Well, obviously the software developedfor humanoid robots is extremely hard. However, the benefit is incredible. There are only two robotic systems thatcan be easily deployed into the world. The first robot is a self-driving car,and the reason for that is because we created the worldto adapt to cars. The second is humanoid robots. These two robotic systemscould be deployed in brownfields anywhere in the world. Because we created the world for us. This is both extraordinarilyhard technology that the time has come,but the impact can be enormous. Well, this last week at the Conferencefor Robotics Learning, we announced a new frameworkthat is super important. It's called Isaac Lab. Isaac Lab is a reinforcementlearning virtual simulation system that allows you to teach humanoid robotshow to be humanoid robots. And on top of it, we have severalworkflows that we have created. The first workflow is Groot-Mimic. Groot-Mimic is a frameworkfor demonstrating to the robot how to perform a task. You use human demonstration and then mimic that environment, using domain randomization generates hundreds of other exampleslike your demonstration. So that the robot can learn to generalize. Otherwise it can only performthat very specific task. Using Mimic,we can generalize its learning. The second is Groot-Gen. Groot-Gen, using generativeAI technology in Omniverse, we can create an enormous number of random, domain randomized examples of environments and the actionsthat we would like the robot to perform. And so we're generating a whole bunchof tests, evaluation systems, evaluation scenariosthat the robot can try to perform and improve itself, learnhow to be a good robot. And the third is Groot-Control. Groot-Control is a model distillationframework that allows us to take all of the skills that we've learnedand distill it into one unified model that allows the robot to performkinematic skills. Not only will robots be autonomous, but remember thatthe future factories will also be robotic. And so these factoriesare going to be robotic factories that are orchestrating robots, buildingmechanical systems that are robotic. Let me show it to you. Physical AI embodies robots like self-driving carsthat safely navigate the real world, manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks, and humanoid robotswho work collaboratively alongside us. Plants and factories will be embodiedby physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operationsor speaking to us. NVIDIA builds three computers to enable developersto create physical AI. The models are first trained on DGX, then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcementlearning physics feedback in Omniverse. And the trained AI runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX robotics computers. NVIDIA Omniverse is a physics-basedoperating system for physical AI simulation. Robots learn and fine tune their skills in Isaac Lab,a robot gym built on Omniverse. And with GR00T workflows like GR00T-Gen to generate diverselearning environments and layouts, GR00T-Mimic to generate large scalesynthetic motion datasets based on a small number of real-world captures, and GR00T-Controlfor neural whole body control. This is just one robot. Future factories will orchestrate teamsof robots and monitor entire operationsthrough thousands of sensors. For factory digital twins, they use an Omniverseblueprint called Mega. With Mega, the factory digital twin is populatedwith virtual robots and their AI models—the robots' brains. The robots execute a task by perceivingtheir environment, reasoning, planning their next motion,and finally converting it to actions. These actions are simulated in the environmentby the World Simulator in Omniverse, and the results are perceived by the robot brainsthrough Omniverse sensor simulation. Based on the sensor simulations,the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and positionof everything in the factory digital twin. This software in the looptesting brings software defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments,letting industrial enterprises simulate and validate changesin an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world,saving massive risk and cost. The era of physical AI is here, transforming the world'sheavy industries and robotics. Incredible times. So we have two robotic systems. One that's digital. We call AI agents,and you use them in your office, collaborating with your employees. And then the second is a physical AI,physical AI system, robotics. And these physical AIs will be productsthat the company's built. And so companies will use AI to increasethe productivity of our employees. And we will use AI to drive and power the products that we sell. Car companies will have two factoriesin the future one factory to build cars, one factory to produce the AI that runs in the car. Well, this is the robotics revolution. So much activity is going around the worldand I can't imagine a better country to lead the roboticsAI revolution than Japan. And the reason for that is, as you know, this country loves robots. You love robots. You have created some of the world's best robots. These are the robots we grew up with. These arethe robots we've loved our whole lives. I didn't even show some of my favorites, Mazinger Z, Gundam. I hope that Japan will take advantageof the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and combinethat with your expertise in mechatronics. No country in the world has greater skills in mechatronics than Japan. This is an extraordinaryopportunity that you must seize. And so I hope that we can work togetherto make that dream possible. NVIDIA AI inJapan is doing incredibly well. We have so many partners here. We have partners that are building large languagemodels. Institute of Science Tokyo, Rakuten, SoftBank Intuitions, NTT, Fujitsu, NEC, Nagoya University, Kotoba Technologies. We also have if you go to the upper right,the AI clouds. AIST, SoftBank, Sakura Internet, GMO Internet Group, HIGHRESO, KDDI, Rutilea, building AI clouds herefor the ecosystem to flourish here in Japan. So many roboticscompanies are starting to understand the capabilities that AI is now providingto take advantage of the opportunity, Yaskawa, Toyota, Kawasaki, Rapyuta. Medical imaging systems— Canon, Fuji Films, Olympus—all taking advantage of AI because in the future, these medicalinstruments will be much more autonomous. It's almost like a nurseAI agent inside the medical instrument, helping the nurse guide the diagnosis. So many different ways, the drugdiscovery industry, so many different ways that AI is being used. And so I'm delighted. I'm delighted by the advancements here. And we want to go even fasterto take advantage of the revolution of AI. Well, this industry is changing. As I said earlier, the computer industryhas fundamentally changed. From coding that runs on CPU to now machine learning running on GPUs. From an industry that produced software, we have now become an industry that is manufacturingartificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligenceis produced in factories. They're running 24/7. When you license software, you install it onto your computer. The manufacturing, the distributionof that software is complete. However, intelligence is never complete. And you're interacting with all of the AIs, whether they're AI agents or AI robots. And the tokens, the intelligence is expressed in tokens,which is the unit of intelligence. It's a number. And these numbers are constituted. These tokens are constituted in waysthat becomes intelligence and words, intelligence in steering wheels,intelligence for self-driving cars, intelligence in motors to articulate human robots, intelligence in proteins and chemicalsand drug discovery. All of these tokens are being producedin these factories, these infrastructure,these factories never existed before. It's a brand new thing, which is the reason why we're seeingso much development around the world. For the very first time, we have a new industry, a new factory producing somethingbrand new, that we call artificial intelligence. These factorieswill be built by companies. They'll be built. Every company will be an AI manufacturer. Of course, no company can afford not to manufacture,produce, artificial intelligence. How can any company affordnot to produce intelligence? How can any country affordnot to produce intelligence? You don't have to produce chips. You don't have to produce software,but you have to produce intelligence. It is vital. It is core to who you are. It is core to who we are. And so we have the new industry, AI factories. And that's the reason why I call it. It's a new industrial revolution. The last time this happenedwas 300 years ago when electricity was discovered,the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricityand a new type of factory was created. And that new factory was a power plant. And then a new industrywas created called energy. Several hundred years ago, there was no such thingas an energy industry. It happenedduring the Industrial Revolution. Now we have a new industry,never existed before. Artificial intelligence sits on top of the computer industry,but it's utilized, it is created by every industry. You have to create your own AI. The drug industry—creates your own AI. The automotive industry—creates your own AI. The robotics industry—creates your own AI. Every industry, every company,every country must produce your own AI. A new industrial revolution. I have a very big announcement to make. Today we're announcing that we're partneringwith SoftBank to bring and to build an AI infrastructure for Japan. Together, we're going to buildJapan's largest AI factory. It's going to be built out of NVIDIA DGX. When it's built, it'll have 25 AI exaflops. Just remember, the largest supercomputer in the world just recently was 1 exaflop. This is 25 exaflops for an AI factory to produce the AI. But in order to distribute the AI,SoftBank is going to integrate NVIDIA's Aerial, which was the engine that I mentioned earlier,running the 5G radio on CUDA. By doing that, we can unify and combine the radio computers, the basebands and the AI computers from 5G-RAN. We can now evolve and reinventthe telecommunications network into AI-RAN. It will be able to carry voice,data, video, but in the future we will also carry AI, a new type, a new type of information: intelligence. This will be distributed across SoftBank's200,000 sites here in Japan, serve 55 million customers. AI factoryand to produce the AI, and AI distributionnetworks to distribute AI-RAN to distribute the AI. We're also going to put on top of it a new type of store, an AI store, so that the AIs that were createdby SoftBank and the AIs created by third parties could be providedto the 55 million customers. So we will build those applications on top of NVIDIA AI enterprise,as I mentioned, showed you before and there will be a new storethat makes AI available to everybody. This is just a magnificent development. What will result is an AI grid that runs across Japan. Now this AI grid will be part of infrastructureand one of the most important infrastructures. Remember, you need factories and roads,part of the infrastructure so that you could just make and distributegoods. You need energy and communications,it's part of the infrastructure. Every time you create somethingfundamentally new for the infrastructure, new industries and new companies are created, new economic opportunities, new prosperity. If not for roads and factories,how would we have the Industrial Revolution? If not for energy and communications, how would we have the IT revolution? Each one of these new infrastructuresopen up new opportunities, and so it's incredibly excitingfor me to partner with SoftBank to make this possible in Japan. Miyakawa-san's team, they should be in the audience. Partnering with you is incredible. And, really, really happythat we're doing this. This is completely revolutionary. This is the first of its kind to transform the telecommunications network,the communications network, into an AI network. Well, let me show you what you can do. There's some amazing things you could do. For example, I'm standing underneath one of the base stations, one of the radio towers, and the car has video, and the car’s video is streamed to the radio tower and the radio tower has AI. This radio tower has video intelligence. It has vision intelligence. So it could see what the car sees and it can understandwhat the car is seeing. That AI model may be too heavyto put inside the car, but it's not too heavy to put in the base station. And using the videothat's streamed to the base station, it can understand anything that'shappening to the car and surrounding. Okay, so this is just one example of using AI at the edge to keep people safe. Or maybe this is the air traffic control, essentially, for self-driving cars. The applications are endless. We can also use this basic concept to turn a whole factory into an AI. This is a factory on this side. Lots of cameras. The cameras are streamed to the base station. And what's amazing is this: because of all the cameras and the AI model in the AI-RAN, now this factory became an AI. You can talk to the factory. Ask the factory, what is happening? Ask the factory, were there any accidents? Is there anything abnormal happening? Was anybody injured today? Could it give you a daily report? You just have to ask the factory, becausethe factory now has turned into an AI. That AI model doesn'thave to run in the factory. That AI model can run in the SoftBank radio. Okay, so that's another example. But the countless examples,you can basically turn every single physical object into an AI, a stadium, a road, a factory,a warehouse, an office, a building. They can all become AIs and you can justtalk to it, just like you can talk to ChatGPT. Okay. What's the condition of the aisles? Any obstruction or spills? You're just talking to the factory. And the factory has observed everything. It understands what it sees. It can reason and it can plan an action or just talk to you. And here it says \"No, the aisles in the warehouse did not have any obstruction, spills or hazards. The conditions of the aisles in the video appears to be well-organized, clean, and free of obstacles or hazards.\" Okay, so you're talking to the factory. It's incredible. You're talking to the warehouse. You're talking to the car. Because all of thesehave now become intelligent. Well, I have a very special guestto talk about our announcement today and also to talk aboutbringing AI to Japan. And this friend of mine,this friend of mine. You might know him. That's the two of us. You might know him. This friend of mine is really,genuinely unique. Where is Masa? Where is Son-san? Is he here? He’s here. Hey! Son-san. Ladies and gentlemen. The great Masa. Great Jensen. Let me let me tell you something. I don't know if you know this. So we've been in, I've been in thetechnology industry a long time. Started in the PC revolution. The computer industry went from PC to Internet, to cloud, to mobile cloud, to AI. Long journey. Masa is the only entrepreneuronly entrepreneur, only innovator in the world that has selected the winner and partnered with the winner, in every single generation. Remember, it was Masa thatbrought Bill Gates to Japan. It was Masa that invented or brought,Jerry Yang to Japan. It was Masa that made it possible for China'scloud industry to happen— Alibaba. It was Masa that brought Steve Jobsto Japan and the iPhone. And maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point Masa was the largest shareholder of NVIDIA. Yes. Oh. It’s okay. We can we can cry. We can cry together. Yeah. Sit down. Sit. How did you do it? How did you pick the innovators, the creators of each one of the technology revolutionsin the history of computing? 100% record. Well, I think I was just lucky. I was born in the right time, and I met with great entrepreneurslike yourself, right? It's a passion. It's a dream. And it's an instinct that you smell, is the real pioneer who is a real, you know, innovator. And, I really think I was lucky, but it's the same visionthat we can smell, right? It's like, wolf smell wolf. I think we smell each other. I have two puppies. I don't like that mental image. No. No. Masa, each, as you think back on the history. Yes.- How is this transition, this platform shift,this revolution, how is this one differentthan the previous ones? How does it feel different to you? Well, I say this is the most exciting,most dynamic, front end of the future. This is 100 times, a thousand times bigger. This is the biggest wave. I thought that's how it feels. Yeah, yeah. I think mathematicallyor from an industrial perspective, the important thing to realizeis that although AI is software,it is a very different type of software. Yeah. The software industry you and I created, and are part of is an industry of tools. It's tools used by humans. Yeah. For the very first time,this new type of software, neural network, Large Language Models, agents, robots are not tools, but they are skills. They're tasks. They do work. - Yeah. They can perform work. And the industry, the market,the industry of work is not $1 trillion, it is $100 trillion. And that's the reason why we realized that this industry is, in fact, not a transition of the IT industry. But this is a transition of every industry.- Yes. Which is the reason why it’s such a big deal. Yeah. Mankind is the only animal that has the super braincompared to any other species. Because of brain power, mankind is so powerful. If you compare just the muscles, lions and the elephants,they have a bigger muscle. But mankind has the smartest brain. And every activity of GDPs today is based onmankind's type of brain activity. So I think every industry will be affected by this revolution. And one of the one of the amazing things,of course, is that, in the industry that is governed by atoms, the size of the industry is limited. Because there's only so much atomsyou can move around. It's heavy. - That's right. But the industry of AIis industry of electrons. Exactly. It's governed by quantum mechanics. Right, right, right. It can be infinitely large. Yeah. And intelligence. Intelligence is so much more valuable compared to just moving things. You know, you think, chain of thought, reasoning. It's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah, Masa one of the things that we announced todaytogether is building the AI grid of Japan. Yeah, yeah. And the AI grid will have AI factoriesfor developing the AI models. It will have AI-RAN distribute the AI models all over Japan. The architecture of theAI factory in the AI-RAN that we worked on togetheris revolutionary. Yeah. The world has nothing like this. Japan will be the world's first. Yeah, every other telco will have to follow thisnew wave. Yeah. And. And so several things thatthat I want to ask you. So one, how would SoftBank use this yourselffor SoftBank and your subsidiaries? And how do you imagine this AI gridwill revolutionize AI here in Japan? Yeah, as you just mentioned our cell towersused to just carry bits for the telecommunication and internetsurfing and so on. However, now with this intelligence network that we densely connect each other, becomes one big neural brain, right? For the infrastructureof intelligence for Japan. That will be amazing. - Yeah. You know, and of course, you could use itfor your subsidiaries like LINE, Yahoo Japan. And PayPay. That's right.- Yeah. And so it will create AIs to make all of your servicesmore enjoyable and more useful to your consumers. But one of the things that I'm very excited about ismaking this resource available so that, so that, researchers and students,startup companies can flourish here in Japan. Yes, definitely. And with your support, we are creating the largest AI data center here in Japan, which, I'm talking with Miyakawa that we should providethis platform to many of those researchers, the students, the startups, so that we, we can encourage with, we are trying to subsidize so thatthey have a better access, much more compute. Yeah. Well, building infrastructureis very capital intensive. And you're making a very big bet on Japan. - Yes. You know that you and I have spokenabout this before. In a lot of ways, Japan technology leddoing the mechatronics era. Yes.- During that industrial revolution when when mechanical technologyelectronics came together. In fact, even consumer electronics, during that age, Japanreally led the world, right? And then when, when theIT industry came and software came, there was a, there was a missthat I think the last three decades, as the software industries flourishedin the West and in China, really, Japan could have beenmore aggressive. Totally agree. Totally. Yeah. And back in those days,even to some extent today, big enterprise, the medias, the big grown up guys, they used to say, 'monozukuri'—meaning, ‘making physical stuff.’ Physical stuff has the real value and the real meaning. And software is something virtualthat they don't trust, the value of software. That has been the mentality for many, many years in Japan that led young, startup guys, the young,you know, generations discouraged, especially after the net bubble crash. Everybody criticized. I was criticized a lot. And that really, you know, was sort oflike a punishment to the young stars. Made, you know, the, depressed feeling. I think we have to revive this passionwhich the robotics is bringing with AI. As you say, you know,bring AI intelligence into robotics. Astro Boy, in Japan, we call ‘Tetsuwan Atomu.’My favorite cartoon. You cannot just have the muscle. It has to have, intelligenceso that the robot can talk. Robot can have a passion,as a friend, you know. I think that kind of, front end challengeis, is very, very needed here. Yeah. Yeah, I think the software era was, is now, The good news is thatthis is the beginning of a new era. Yeah. Reset. Once more, reset. Reset button. That’s right. The industry is in reset. And you could see that the entire stackis being reset because the companies of the last generation arenot doing so well in this new generation. That's right. And so there's an emergence of a wholenew stack, a whole new opportunity. Right. Japan must take advantage.Must take advantage of this time. And artificial intelligence is verydifferent than software. Artificial intelligence requiresthat you have data, that you have domain expertise. Yes. If you are an artist,you have domain expertise, if you develop video games,you have domain expertise. If you look for drugs, you discover drugs,you have domain expertise. If you have domain expertise,you can describe your expertise in data. That data could be used to trainan AI model. That AI model becomesyour artificial intelligence. That's right. At least, Japanese government is not trying to, you know, depress the, this AI revolution. Some of the other countries, they try to be overprotective of the, intelligence, artificial intelligence, so the regulation goes a little crazy. Here in Japan, at least we are lucky that this time Japanese government seems not, you know, trying to,depress, at least no handicap. So I think, but they should encourage more. They should encourage more. As you said, this is the reset. This is the catch up momentfor this new revolution. We can't miss this time. Cannot miss this time. And of course, in order to be partof the AI revolution, you need, this time, you need infrastructure.- Right. This type of software,because it's machine learning. We’re gonna buy a lot of your chips. Well, thank you, thank you. - Yes. And and, you need infrastructure. You need AI factories. Without the infrastructure,it's not possible to create AI. Totally. That's the reason why SoftBank is buildingthe AI grid in Japan. And you will catalyze, you will activate,you’ll turbocharge all of the activity that's here already. We're going to show by our example. Yeah. And hopefully, todaywe have 350 startups in Japan. 350 startups that we work with out of 22,000 in the world. Yeah. It makes no sense. That's right. And so we we must encourage,the young entrepreneurs, the innovators. Yeah, yeah. To jump, to leap, to engage AI. The infrastructure is coming. Yeah. So as I said, Miyakawa and I are discussing, we're going to create the largestAI data center here in Japan. So we are going to provide a lot of encouraging program. Subsidize the compute power, so that they can they can use almost free. Okay, almost free to try out the new models, try out the, you know, whatever, the applications of AI. You should also help with some donation, right? Okay. Hey, Jensen! For some sort of startup, and researchers— This is the last time I'm inviting myself to—Every time I see Masa, it costs me money. Yeah. That's good for everybody. Yes, yes. Yeah. Very happy about that. Masa, what are you most excited aboutfor the future of AI in Japan? What do you hope? What is your dream? Well, look, you know, as you say,I am passionate about, AI robotics. I think the medical solutions, I think medical agents is definitely coming. I think a lot of, new agents. You know, so we have LINE, we have Yahoo and other services, Paypay. We can make many specific AI agents for, for helping Japanese lifestyle. That cannot just come from US, you know,we know about Japanese behaviors, the cutures, the local intelligence and APIs to many, many, sites in Japan. So that I think, agents, I think every—you mentioned about, enterprise AI agents, definitely I support that. I'm excited about that. But also, I think personal agents willreally come to every one of us. Bill gates said, the PC on every desktop. Steve said, a smartphone in every hand. I think now we should say, AI agents to everybody. So each of usshould have our own personal agents. That's right. That will help make our plans for trips,vacations. Right? Education. And it follows you your whole life. Yeah. Yeah. Could you imagine an AI agentthat knows you your whole life? Exactly. Our grandkids, they grow up with, iPhones from, you know, age one, right? They talk, and every timethey see some picture, they do this even with a still picture. Right? Because they are born the,you know, with two fingers, they can they think, you know,every picture can be, blown up. In the future, they'll see a picture,they'll talk to it. Right. They talk. They'll hope it talks back.You can ask it questions. They will have agent, their personal agentssince the age of one and their personal agent, like your,you know, second buddy to see you grow together with you knows everything. You are sick. You know, your health. Your tutor. Yeah. Yeah. Since you were a child. Exactly. Yeah. Remember everything that you read? Remember everything that it taught you,right? That. Yeah. Your personal Aristotle. Totally, totally digital twin. You know? I think that is really coming and having, you know, Japanese domestic knowledge, culture and so on, homegrown agents will have a huge, amazing future. You know, one of the thingsMasa, that countries are awakening to is that the data of their country, their, their citizens' data, encodes the country's knowledge, its culture, its intelligence. And that data belongs to the countrylike its national resources. National security, national security. So that country, every country,should process that data, process and turn it into itsAI for its own people. Totally, totally. Makes no sense to outsourcethat to somebody else. Oh, this is this is very, very important.It's a sovereign data center. Their each sovereign, each country, each governmenthave to migrate, their national security data into their own data center,AI data center. That becomes the, something that you have to havein your own country. Each country have to havenational security, data security. I think that will become, regulated to each protection of each country. Yeah. Every country, every countrywill produce its own intelligence. Of course, every companywill produce their own intelligence. Their own AI. How is it possible that a company, does not create its own AI? Yeah. A company doesn't— It’s like giving your brain away to somebody else. That's right, that's right. And so I think, I think,the world is awakening to this idea. And the most important part is the first part, is that a national grid, an AI grid, has to exist. Right. You cannot have an automotive industryif there are no roads. Totally, totally. You know, and so so now you havebuilt the AI roads for Japan. On top of it, you know, all kinds of new services,new companies can flourish. Totally. So really, really excited about that. Well, Masa-san. Could you imagine if today, you were the largest shareholder. Oh my God. [laughs] Yeah. We tried this. We tried, we tried to. It was three times. Was it three times?I thought it was two times. No, no. The first time, we became yourshareholder by ourselves buying from the market. We talked about the, you know, the... We even talked about. Some things we can share.- Right? You and I had a private talk. I don't want, don't say it. You know, ten years ago—- Oh, I know. I have regretted it. —in my garden. All right. There's nothing. Okay, let me tell you what Masa said. Are you guys ready? So Masa said, “Jensen, the market does notunderstand the value of NVIDIA. Your future is incredible. But the marketdoesn't understand it.� That was ten years ago. “And your journey of suffering will continue for some time.Because you are inventing this future.� “ So, let me give you the money to buy NVIDIA.� He wanted to lend me money to buy NVIDIA. All of it. Now I regret not taking you up on it. That was a great idea. Oh, that was a great idea right? Now, now we're both sad. That was one month after I acquired Arm. Yes, yes. And then we talked aboutcombining the two companies. That was another. Another.That was a good dream too. That was the third one.That was the third attempt. Yeah, right. The first we talked about this privatizing and then second was weI just bought from the market. And then the third time was merging. Three attempts! Oh my god. Well now we are going to we're going to createincredible value together. So NVIDIA and SoftBankare going to partner together. Yeah. The market is so huge! It's incredible. So huge, so huge. And so I am so happy. I'm so happy that that we're doingsomething of this great significance. Yeah. Here in Japan, I, I am very hopeful. Well, this is just the beginning. We're going to do many,many things together. Thank you. And the industry is so big and, you know,Arm has lots of mobile and IoTs and autos. And you have a great datacenters and games and so forth. Many, many things that we can collaborate. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah.Masa-san! Ladies and gentlemen, Son-san. Yeah. Unquestionably one of the great entrepreneursthe world ever seen. No, no. You are the greatest. - Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you. Masa-san. You could seeyou could see his passion for AI. The work, the partnership that we'redeveloping is going to bring an AI grid throughout Japan from the factoryto the distributed AI-RANs. Before I before I leave, I wantto welcome all of you to AI Summit. We have so many sessions here,so many partners here. Our purpose. Our purpose is to partner with you, to bring AI, to activate AI here in Japan, and to use this reset, this opportunity,where technology has reset for us to transform the companies and to create the nextgreat companies here in Japan. Japan has always been dear to me. Most of you do not know that if not for Japan and I mean this very seriously, if not for Japan,NVIDIA would not be here today. And there's a reason for that. If not for Japan,we would have not seen the first AI supercomputer, CUDA supercomputer built. So Japan has been very dear to mefor a very long time. I'm very grateful for our partnership. I'm very grateful for your friendship. And I made a small videoto share with you. Please run it. “If there is a heart in the fish, there is a heart in the water.� Our friendship with Japan began 30 years ago. “Ready? Go!� We had a dream to reinvent 3D graphics. SEGA, with its groundbreaking 3D games, chose NVIDIA to build its next game console. But it became clear our unconventional approach would not live up to our vision. With humility, we asked SEGA’s Irimajiri-San to release us from our obligations. He generously agreed, giving us the time needed to invent the GPU, a chance for success — saving our company. In the years since, we've worked with Japan to redefine gaming on the PlayStation 3, SEGA Arcades, and the Nintendo Switch. And created a medium for telling beautiful stories. With the invention of CUDA, we transitioned from a gaming company to a computing company. As we expanded into the world of Supercomputing and AI, it was Japan's then Tokyo Tech that first saw the promise of GPU accelerated computing. “It’s just the beginning of GPU acceleration becoming mainstream.� Less than a decade after Tsubame, we introduced DGX-1. The AI computer that changed the world. “A GPU is not just a GPU anymore.� NVIDIA and AI are now at the center of a new industrial revolution. From the beginning, Japan has been a friend on the NVIDIA journey. And our story together is just getting started. Thank you, Japan. Have a great AI Summit. Thank you. please welcome Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Applause] Hong hello [Applause] mumai wow it's so great to be here Mumbai so much happening this is as you know India very very dear to the world's computer industry Central to the IT industry at the center at the core of the it of just about every single company in the world my industry your industry that we've built over the last several decades is going through fundamental change seismic change tectonic shifts let's talk about that today but before we start let me thank all of our partners our incredible partners that we're working with here in India to transform the IT industry together and so I'm delighted that all of you have joined us today there are two fundamental shifts that are happening at the same time this hasn't happened since 1964 the year after my birth it wasn't because of my birth but in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced the world to the concept of it the IT industry as we know it introduced the idea of general purpose Computing they described a central processing unit a CPU IO subsystems multitasking the separation of hardware and application software through a layer called the operating system IBM described family compatibility for application so that you could benefit by the install base of your Hardware to run your software over a long period of time they described architectural benefit across Generations so that the investment that you make in software the Investments you make in using the software is not squandered every single time you buy new hardware they recognized in 1964 the importance of in based the importance of software investment the importance of building computers that run the software architecture discipline all described in 1964 I've just described today's computer industry the same industry that the India IT industry was built from general purpose Computing as we know it has existed for 60 years until now for the last 30 years we've had the benefit of mors law an incredible phenomenon without changing the software the hardware can continue to improve in an architecturally compatible way and the benefits of that software doubles every year as a result of doubling in performance every year depending on what your applications you're reducing your cost by a factor of two every single year the most incredible depreciating force of any technology the world's ever known by depreciation cost reduction it made it possible for society to use more and more of it as we continue to consume it as we continue to process more data mors law made it possible for us to continue to drive down cost the critizing Computing as we know it today those two events the invention of the system 360 More's law with Windows PC drove what unquestionably one of the most important industries in the world every single industry has subsequently been built on top of it it but we know now that the scaling of CPUs has reached its limit we can't continue to ride that curve that that free Free Ride The Free Ride of Moors law has ended we have to now do something different or depreciation will end and we now will not enjoy depreciation but experience inflation Computing inflation and that's exactly what's happening around the world we no longer can afford to do nothing in software and expect that our computing experience will continue to improve that cost will decrease and continue to spread the benefits of it and to benefit from solving greater and greater challenges we started our company to accelerate software our vision was there are applications that would benefit from acceleration if we augmented general purpose Computing we take the workload that is very computer intensive and we offload it and we accelerate it using a model we call Cuda a programming model that we invented called cuda that made it possible for us to accelerate applications tremendously that acceleration benefit has the same qualities as mores law for applications that were impossible or impractical to perform using general purpose Computing we have the benefits of accelerated Computing to realize that capability for example computer Graphics real-time computer Graphics was made possible because of Nvidia coming into the world and make possible this new processor we call gpus the GPU was really the first accelerated Computing architecture running Cuda running computer Graphics a perfect example we democratized computer Graphics as we know it 3D Graphics is now literally everywhere it could be used as a medium for almost any application but we felt that longterm accelerated Computing could be far far more impactful and so over the last 30 years we've been on a journey to accelerate one domain of application after another the reason why this has taken so long is simply because of this there is no such magical processor that can accelerate everything in the world because if you could do that you would just call it a CPU you need to reinvent the Computing stack from the algorithms to the architecture underneath and connected to applications on top in one domain after another domain computer Graphics is a beginning but we've taken this architecture Cuda architecture from one industry after another industry after another industry today we accelerate so many important industries ktho is fundamental to semiconductor manufacturing computational lithography simulation computer Aid and Engineering even 5G radios that we've recently announced part Partnerships with that we can accelerate the 5G software stack Quantum Computing so that we can invent the future of computing with classical Quantum hybrid Computing parabricks are Gene sequencing software stack CVS one of the most important things every single company's working on is going from databases to knowledge bases so that we can create AI databases using qvs that we can create and vectorize all of your data qdf data frames data frames is essentially another word for structured data SQL acceleration is possible with qdf in each one of these different libraries we're able to accelerate the application 20 30 50 times of course it takes a rewrite of software which is the reason why it's taken so long in each one of these domains we've had to work with the industry work with our ecosystem software developers and customers in order to accelerate those applications for their domains kopt one of my favorites combinatorial Computing application a very uh Compu intensive application for example the travel salesperson problem every supply chain every driver Rider combination those applications could be accelerated with Coop incredible speed up modulus teaching and AI the laws of physics not just to be able to predict next word but to be able to predict the next moment in time of fluid dynamics and particle physics and so on so forth and of course one of the most famous application libraries we've ever created called cdnn made it possible to democratize artificial intelligence as we know it these acceleration libraries Now cover so many different domains that it appears that accelerated Computing is used everywhere but that's simply because we've applied this architecture one domain after another domain that we've covered just about every single industry now accelerated Computing or Cuda has reached the Tipping Point several years ago about a decade ago something very important happened and most of you have seen the same thing alexnet made a gigantic leap in the performance of computer vision computer vision is a very important field of artificial intelligence Alex net surprised the world with how much of a leap that it was able to produce we had the benefit of taking a step back and asking ourselves what are we witnessing why is alexnet so effective how far can it scale what else can we do with this approach called Deep learning and if we were to find ways to apply deep learning to other problems how does it affect the computer industry and if we wanted to do that if we believe in that future and we're excited about what deep learning can do how would we change every single layer of the Computing stack so that we could reinvent Computing all together 12 years ago we decided to dedicate our entire company to go pursue this Vision it is now 12 years later you every single time I've come to India I've had the benefit of talking to you about deep learning had benefit of talking to you about machine learning and I think it's very very clear now the world has completely changed now let's think about what happened the first thing that happened of course is how we do software our industry is underpinned by the method by which software is done the way that software was done call It software 1.0 program rers would code algorithms we call functions into to run on a computer and we would apply it to input information to predict an output somebody would write python or C or Fortran or Pascal or C++ code algorithms that run on a computer you apply input to it and output is produced very classically the computer model that we understood quite well and it of course created one of the largest Industries in the world right here in India the production of software coding programming became a whole industry this all happened within our generation however that approach of developing software has been disrupted it is now not coding but machine learning using a computer using a computer to study the patterns and relationships of massive amounts of observed data to essentially learn from it the function that predicts it and so we are essentially designing a universal function approximator using machines to learn the expected output that would produce such a function and so going back and forth looking this is software 1.0 with human coding to now software 2.0 using machine learning notice who is writing the software the software is now written by the computer and after you're done training the model you inference the model you then apply that function now as the input that function that large language model that deep learning model that computer vision model speech understanding model is now an input neural network that goes into the GPU that can now make a prediction given new input unobserved input this way of doing software notice is based on fundamentally machine learning and we have gone from coding to machine learning from developing software to creating artificial intelligence and from soft that prefers to run on CPUs to now neural networks that runs best on gpus this at its core is what happened to our industry in the last 10 years we have now seen the complete reinvention of the Computing stack the whole technology stack has been reinvented the hardware the way that software is able is is developed and what software can do is now fundamentally different we dedicated ourselves to advance this field and so this is what we now build what all of you have initially when I first met India we were building gpus that fit into a PCI Express card that goes into your PC this is what a GPU looks like today this is Blackwell incredible system that is designed to study data at an enormous scale yeah thank you a massive system designed to study data at an enormous scale so that we could discover patterns and relationships and learn the meaning of the data this is the Greek breakthrough in the last several years we have now learn the representation or the meaning of words and numbers and images and pixels and videos chemicals proteins amino acids fluid patterns particle physics we have now learned the meaning of so many different types of data we have learned to represent how to represent information in so many different modalities not only have we learned the meaning of it we can translate it to another modality so one great example of course is translating English to Hindi translating English large body of text into other English summarization from pixels to image image recognition from words to pixels image generation from images videos to words captioning from words to proteins used for drug discovery from words to chemicals discovering new compounds from amino acids to proteins understanding the structure of proteins these fundamental ideas essentially a universal translator of information from any modality to another modality has led to a Cambrian explosion of the number of startups in the world they're applying the basic method I just described if I could this and that what else can I do if I can do that and this what else can I do the number of applications has clearly exploded in the last couple two three years the number of generative AI companies around the world tens of thousands tens of billions of dollars have been invested in this field all because of this one instrument that made it possible for us to study data at enormous scales well I just want to say that that in order to build the black wall system of course the Blackwell GPU is involved but it takes seven other chips tsmc manufacture all of these chips and they're just doing an extraordinary job ramping the Blackwell system this is in a all in Blackwell is in full production and we're hoping to uh we're expecting to deliver in volume production in Q4 and so this is basically Blackwell now this is one of the things that's really incredible about about the system let me show it to you nothing's easy this morning this is MV link and it goes across the entire back spine of a rack of gpus and these gpus are all connected from the top to the bottom using MV link driving these incredible cies the world's longest driving CES for copper and it connects uh all of these gpus together 72 dual GPU packages of black WS 144 gpus connected together so it's one giant GPU if I were to spread out all of the chips to show you what this connects together it's essentially a GPU so large it' be like this big but it's obviously impossible to build gpus that large so we break it up into the L the smallest chunks we could which is retical limits and the most Advanced Technologies and we connect it together using MV link this is mvlink backs spine you're looking at all of the gpus being connected that's the quantum switch that connects all of these gpus together on top Spectrum X if you would like to have ethernet and uh what connects this together this is like 50 lbs this I'm just demonstrating how strong I am this is connected to this switch and this is one of the most advanced switches the world's ever built now all of this together represents Blackwell and then it runs the software uh that's on top the Cuda software CNN software uh Megatron for training the large language models tensor RT for doing the inference tensor RT llm for doing uh distributed multi-gpu inference for large language models and then on top of that we have two software Stacks one is NVIDIA AI Enterprise that I'll talk about in a second and then the other is Omniverse I'll talk about both of those in a second this job is surprisingly rigorous so this is the Blackwell system this is what Nvidia builds today those of you who have known us for very long time it's really quite surprising how the company has transformed but literally we reason from first principles how Computing was going to be done in the future and this is Blackwell now the Blackwell system the Blackwell system is extraordinary of course the computation is incredible each rack is 3,000 lb 120 kilowatt Watts 120,000 watts in each rack the density of computing the highest the world's ever known and what we're trying to do is to learn larger and smarter models it's called the scaling law the scaling law comes from the fact that the observation that the empirical observation and measurements that suggests the more data you have to train a large language model with and therefore to correspondingly large model size you know the more information you want to learn from the larger the model has to be or the larger model you would like to train the more data you need to have and each one each year we're increasing the amount of data and the model size each by about a factor of two which means that every single year the computation which is the product of those two has to increase by a factor of four now remember there was a time when the world Mo's law was two times every year and a half or 10 times every 5 years 100 times every 10 years we are now moving technology at a rate of four times every year four times every year over the course of 10 years incredible scaling and we continue to find that AI continues to get smarter as we scale up the uh uh the training size the second thing that we've discovered recently and this is a very big deal after you're done training the model of course uh all of you have used chat GPT when you use chat GPT is a oneshot you ask you give it a prompt instead of writing a program to Compu communicate with a computer today you write a prompt you just talk to the talk to the computer the way you talk to a person you describe the context you describe what it is you're you're querying about uh you could ask it to write a program for you you could you know ask it uh to write a recipe for you whatever question would like to have and the AI process through a very large neural network and produces a sequence of answers producing one one uh one word after another word in the future and starting with strawberry we realize that of course intelligence is not just one shot but intelligence requires thinking and thinking is reasoning and maybe you're doing path planning and maybe you're doing some simulations in your mind you're reflecting on your own answers and so as a result thinking results in higher quality answers and we've now discovered a second scaling law and this is a SCA scaling law at a time of inference the longer you think the higher quality answer you can produce this is not illogical this is very very intuitive to all of us if you were to ask me what's my favorite Indian food I would tell you chicken briani okay and I don't have to think about that very much and I don't have to reason about that I just know it and there are many things that you can ask it like for example what's Nvidia good at Nvidia is good at building AI supercomputers nvidia's uh great at building gpus and those are things that you know that it's encoded into your knowledge however there are many things that requires reasoning you know for example if I had to travel from uh Mumbai to California I I want to do it in the in a way that allows me to enjoy four other cities along the way you know today uh I got here at 3:00 a.m. this morning uh I got here through Denmark I I and right before Denmark I was in Orlando Florida and before Orlando Florida I was in California that was two days ago and I'm still trying to figure out what day we're in right now but anyways I'm happy to be here uh if I were to to tell it I would like to go from California uh to Mumbai uh I would like to do it within uh 3 days uh and I give it all kinds of constraints about what time I'm willing to leave and able to leave what hotels I like to stay at so on so forth uh the people I have to meet the number of permutations of that of course uh quite high and so the planning of that process coming up with a optimal plan is very very complicated and so that's where thinking reasoning planning comes in and the more you compute the higher quality answer uh you could provide and so we now have two fundamental scaling laws that is driving our technology development first for training and now for inference the number of foundation model makers has more than doubled since the beginning of Hopper there are more companies that realize that fundamental intelligence is vital to their company and that they have to build Foundation model technology and second the size of the models have increased by 20 30 40x the amount of computation necessary to train these model because of uh the size of the models but also multimodality capability um reinforcement learning capability synthetic data generation capability the amount of data that we use to train these models has really grown tremendously that's one and then the other reason of course is that Blackwell is also used for generating tokens at incredible speeds and so together all of these factors has led to the demand for Blackwell being incredibly High let's talk about now how we're going to use this technology the headline I thought was really good Nvidia is AI in India now aside from the letter V you could use Nvidia to create the rest of that sentence which I thought was really cool you don't know this story but in 1993 we had to come up with a name for our company and the reason why we chose Nvidia I'll do the extreme short version the reason why I chose Nvidia in the end was because I really love Nvidia being sounds like a mystical Place India Nvidia and sounded like a great place and so if it turns out that computer graphics and accelerated Computing didn't work out for us we could do almost anything and so I'm just happy it worked out okay so so Nvidia in India uh we have we have a really rich ecosystem here uh the first thing that you have to realize is that in order to build an AI ecosystem in any industry or in any country you have to start first with the ecosystem of the infrastructure and we announced that Yoda that ET T Communications and our other partners uh are joining us to build fundamental Computing infrastructure here in India and in just one year's time by the end of this year we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago that's the amount of infrastructure we're y so the first part of building an AI ecosystem is the AI infrastructure just as the first part of uh infrastructure for the internet ecosystem was building the infrastructure of of networking of course uh the infrastructure of networking internet consists of the personal computer cloud and and internet itself um in the case of AI it starts with the AI Computing infrastructure the next part the operating system of AI is large language models and we've worked with Partners here in India to build the Hindi large language model and Hindi large language model as you know there's 25 different um uh formal languages here in in India with apparently um a new a dialect every you know 1,500 kilometers and so so you don't have to go very far before you need to train another model this is the hardest language model region in the world and if anybody could do it you can do it and and once India figures out how to create the Hindi large language model you could you could figure it out for every other country so the next layer is um the application layer above that and uh uh working with us to bring uh AI to uh the ecosystem of India of course uh AI native companies that are creating new applications that are started that made possible only with AI and then our Service Partners uh from from wiipro to infosis to to TCS working with us to take the AI models and the AI infrastructure out to the world's Enterprises now that's Nvidia in India I'm going to have uh Vel our country leader come join me on stage because I would love for him to talk to you about some of the companies that we're working with here in India velle V to par okay so I'm going to intr a couple of other ideas and so earlier I told you that we have Blackwell we have all of the libraries acceleration libraries that we were talking about before but on top there are two very important platforms we working on one of them is called Nvidia AI Enterprise and the other is called Nvidia Omniverse and I'll explain each one of them very Qui quickly first Nvidia AI Enterprise this is a time now where the large language models and the fundamental AI capabilities have reached a level of capabilities were able to now create what is called agents large language models that understand understand the data that of course it's being presented it could be it could be streaming data could video data language model data it could be data of all kinds the first stage is perception the second is reasoning about given its observations uh what is the mission and what is the task it has to perform in order to perform that task the agent would break down the that task into steps of other tasks and uh it would reason about what it would take and it would connect with other AI models some of them are uh good at produ for example understanding PDF maybe it's a model that understands how to generate images maybe it's a model that uh uh is able to retrieve information AI information AI semantic data from a uh proprietary database so each one of these uh large language models models are connected to the central reasoning large language model we call agent and so these agents are able to perform all kinds of tasks uh some of them are maybe uh marketing agents some of them are customer service agents some of them are chip design agents Nvidia has Chip design agents all over our company helping us design chips maybe they're software engineering uh agents uh maybe uh uh maybe they're able to do marketing campaigns uh Supply Chain management and so we're going to have agents that are helping our employees become super employees these agents or agentic AI models uh augment all of our employees to supercharge them make them more productive now when you think about these agents it's really the way you would bring these agents into your company is not unlike the way you would onboard uh someone uh who's a new employee you have to give them training curriculum you have to uh fine-tune them teach them how to use uh how to perform the skills and understand the vocabulary of your of your company uh you evaluate them and so they evaluation systems and you might guardrail them if you're accounting agent uh don't do marketing if you're a marketing agent you know don't report earnings at the end of the quarter so on so forth and so each one of these agents are guardrail um that entire process we put into essentially an agent life cycle Suite of library and we call that Nemo our partners are working with us to integrate these libraries into their platforms so that they could enable agents to be created onboarded deployed improved into a life cycle of agents and so this is what we call Nvidia Nemo we have um on the one hand the libraries on the other hand what comes out of the output of it is a API inference microser service we call Nims essentially this is a factory that builds AIS and Nemo is a suite of libraries that on board and help you operate the AIS and ultimately your goal is to create a whole bunch of Agents we have Partners here that we're working with in India and Vel if you could tell everybody about our ecosystem here absolutely Jensen you know the word that stuck me as I was standing behind was was a word called Mystique this is the Mystique of India Jensen was here exactly 12 months back and he asked me a pretty profound question that the rich tapestry of India how are you going to encode it and it All Began from the infrastructure as mentioned in just 12 months today we have Computing from Yota which has built the stateof thee art y infrastructure tatas are going live E2 e2e has been in existence giving us exceled Computing infrastructure for a long long period of time all this Computing helped us to leave frog to solve one of India's largest problem that is about communication like Jensen said we speak in so many languages he did say 1500 kilm but all of you know every 5050 kilomet we change our dialect we don't only speak English we speak English and if you are from South there'll be a little bit of malali also added into it so how do we make this really work is the work of some of our partners Serum is a classical example serum basically started their efforts to basically help India talk they decided we're going to do voice to voice and and while doing voice to voice they had to understand how does this language work which is multimodal how do we make sure that it performs and they came into existence pretty quickly because there was infrastructure that was available to us similarly we saw projects coming from bhat GPT again a work that has been done predominantly in Academia the Academia in India has been rich with ideas and every time they wanted an idea to be translated into reality they need infrastructure today the work that we are doing in iits the work that we are doing at different organization is all a result of coming together solving the critical issue that India Has Not only was the language getting solved we also realized very quickly that there are many mega challenges that India has no one loves India more than Michelle a well spoken Indian and a healthy Indian always make a difference and that's why we have companies who've been working on health as many of us know it's been challenging how do we look after our health but Diagnostics coming from s Tuple cure. is really helping us solve many of these challenges so with that promise Jensen that's awesome healthy yeah and well spoken healthy and well spoken and the the important thing here that the uh it takes an entire ecosystem of Partners to be able to help the world apply AI to help their employees be more productive and this is whereas India was focused on it the back office operations of software the delivery of software producing software the next generation of it is going to be about producing and delivery of AI and as you know the delivery of software coding and the delivery of AI is fundamentally different but dramatically more impactful insanely more exciting and the ability for this industry for India to help every single company around the world to enjoy the benefit of Agents to enjoy the benefits of AIS across all of their different functionalities to be able to deploy it at scale I don't know anybody else who could do it this is just an extraordinary opportunity our job is to help you build Ai and deploy AI your job is to take these libraries and the capabilities that we have combine it with your incredible it capability software capabilities so that we can create agents and help every single company benefit from it and so this is the first part the second part is this what happens after agents now remember every single company has employees but most companies the goal is to build something to produce something to make something and that those things that people make could be factories it could be warehouses it could be cars and planes and trains and uh ship ships and so on and so forth all kinds of things computers and servers the servers that Nvidia builds it could be phones most companies in the largest of Industries ultimately produces something sometimes produce production of service which is the IT industry but many of your customers are about producing something those that next generation of AI needs to understand the physical world we call it physical AI in order to create physical AI we need three computers and we created three computers to do so the dgx computer which Blackwell for example is is a reference design an architecture for to create things like dgx computers for training the model that model needs a place to be refined it needs a place to learn it needs the place to apply its physical capability it's robotics capability we call that Omniverse a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics where robots can learn to be robots and then when you're done with the training of it that AI model could then run in the actual robotic system that robotic system could be a car it could be a robot it could be AV it could be a autonomous moving robot it could be a a picking arm uh it could be an entire Factory or an entire Warehouse that's robotic and that computer we call agx Jetson agx dgx for training and then Omniverse for doing the digital twin now here here in India we've got a really great ecosystem who is working with us to take this infrastructure take this ecosystem of capabilities to help the world build physical AI systems and you know what I've really loved is adorb is one of the largest robotics company they build Robotics and more importantly they put it in a digital twin where optimization takes place they teach the robo all the inputs that comes out of the physical world not only is that work taking place our system integrators asenta TCS Tech Mahindra are taking that knowledge not only into India but also outside India so do it in India for India and do from India for globe start locally grow globally right right that's fantastic okay thank you thank you thank you very much Michelle thank you thank you we made a short video to help you put everything together that I just said run it please for 60 years software 1.0 code written by programmers ran on general purpose CPUs then software 2.0 arrived machine learning neural networks running on gpus this led to the Big Bang of generative AI models that learn and generate anything today generative AI is revolutionizing $100 trillion in Industries knowledge Enterprises use agentic AI to automate digital work hello I'm James a digital human Industrial Enterprises use physical AI to automate physical work physical AI embodies robots like self-driving cars that safely navigate the real world manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks and humanoid robots who work collaboratively alongside us plants and factories will be embodied by physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operations or speaking to us Nvidia builds three computers to enable developers to create physical AI the models are first trained on dgx then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcement learning physics feedback in Omniverse and the trained AI runs on Nvidia Jetson agx robotics computers Nvidia Omniverse is a physics-based operating system for physical AI simulation robots learn and fine-tune their skills in Isaac lab a robot gym built on Omniverse this is just one robot future factories will orchestrate teams of robots and monitor entire operations through thousands of sensors for factory digital digal twins they use an Omniverse blueprint called Mega with mega the factory digital twin is populated with virtual robots and their AI models the robots brains the robots execute a task by perceiving their environment reasoning planning their next motion and finally converting it to actions these actions are simulated in the environment by the world simulator in Omniverse and the results are perceived by the robot brains through Omniverse sensor simulation based on the sensor simulations the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and position of everything in the factory digital twin this software in the loop testing brings softwar defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments letting Industrial Enterprises simulate and validate changes in an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world saving massive risk and cost the era of physical AI is here transforming the world's heavy Industries and Robotics [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music]

let's get started good take good take oh oh je okay you guys ready yeah yeah everybody thinks we make GPS I video is so much more than [Music] that this whole keynote is going to be about that okay so we'll start at the top examples of the use cases and then seeing it in action that's kind of the flow in such your compelling story I'm super nervous about this just got to get in the Rhythm we're 2 weeks away from you guys can go really really make it bre we should take a swing at it yeah that's the plan we need to get daily status on that animation can you mute cuz I hear myself sorry what's the drop date for all the videos it needs to be done on the 28th did you get all that safe travels everybody super excited to see everyone see you guys soon okay bye we're basically moving as fast as the world can absorb technology so we've got to LEAP from ourselves [Music] in now the spine you just have to figure out a way to make it pop you know what I'm [Music] saying you know what I'm saying you want to yeah that kind of thing [Music] okay thank you I'm super late let's [Music] go please welcome welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Music] W I am very happy to be back thank you NTU for letting us use your Stadium the last time I was here I received a degree from [Applause] n and I gave the Run don't walk speech and today we have a lot to cover so I cannot walk I must run we have a lot to cover I have many things to tell you I'm very happy to be here in Taiwan Taiwan is the home of our treasured Partners this is in fact where everything Nvidia does begins our partners and ourselves take it to the world Taiwan and our partnership has created the world's AI infrastructure today I want to talk to you about several things one what is happening and the meaning of the work that we do together what is generative AI what is its impact on our industry and on every industry a blueprint for how we will go forward and engage this incredible opportunity and what's coming next generative Ai and its impact our blueprint and what comes next these are really really exciting times a restart of our computer industry an industry that you have forged an IND industry that you have created and now you're prepared for the next major Journey but before we start Nvidia lives at the intersection of computer graphics simulations and artificial intelligence this is our soul everything that I show you today is simulation it's math it's science it's computer science it's amazing computer architecture none of it's animated and it's all homemade this is invidious soul and we put it all into this virtual world we called Omniverse please enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] when doubt [Applause] I want to speak to you in Chinese but I have so much to tell you I have to think too hard to speak Chinese so I have to speak to you in English at the foundation of everything that you saw was two fundamental Technologies accelerated Computing and artificial intelligence running inside the Omniverse those two technologies those two fundamental forces of computing are going to reshape the computer industry the computer industry is now some 60 years old in a lot of ways everything that we do today was invented the year after my birth in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced central processing units general purpose Computing the separation of hardware and software through an operating system multitasking IO subsystems dma all kinds of technologies that we use today architectural compatibility backwards compa ibility family compatibility all of the things that we know today about Computing largely described in 1964 of course the PC Revolution democratized Computing and put it in the hands and the houses of everybody and then off in 2007 the iPhone introduced mobile Computing and put the computer in our pocket ever since everything is connected and running all the time through the mobile cloud this last 60 years we saw several just several not that many actually two or three major technology shifts two or three tectonic shifts in Computing where everything changed and we're about to see that happen again there are two fundamental things that are happening the first is that the processor the engine by which the computer industry runs on the central processing unit the performance scaling has slowed tremendously and yet the amount of computation we have to do is still doubling very quickly exponentially if processing requirement if the data that is that we need to process continues to scale exponentially but performance does not we will experience computation inflation and in fact we're seeing that right now as we speak the amount of data center power that's used all over the world is growing quite substantially the cost of computing is growing we are seeing computation inflation this of course cannot continue the data is going to continue to increase exponentially and CPU performance scaling will never return there is a better way for almost two decades now we've been working on accelerated Computing Cuda augments a CPU offloads and accelerates the work that A specialized processor can do much much better in fact the performance is so extraordinary that it is very clear now as CPU scaling has slowed and event substantially stopped we should accelerate everything I predict that every application that is processing intensive will be accelerated and surely every data center will be accelerated the near future now accelerated Computing is very sensible it's very common sense if you take a look at an application and here the 100t means 100 units of time it could be 100 seconds it could be 100 hours and in many cases as you know we're now working on artificial intelligence applications that run for a 100 days the ont is code that is requires sequential processing where single-threaded CPUs are really quite essential operating systems control logic really essential to have one instruction executed after another instruction however there are many algorithms computer Graphics is one that you can operate completely in parallel computer Graphics image processing physics simulations combinatorial optimizations graph processing database processing and of course the very famous linear algebra of deep learning there are many types of algorithms that are very conducive to acceleration through parallel processing so we invented an architecture to to do that by adding the GPU to the CPU the specialized processor can take something that takes a great deal of time and accelerate it down to something that is in incredibly fast and because the two processors can work side by side they're both autonomous and they're both separate independent that is we could accelerate what used to take a 100 units of time down to one unit of time well the speed up is incredible it almost sounds unbelievable it almost sounds unbelievable but today I'll demonstrate many examples for you the benefit is quite extraordinary a 100 times speed up but you only increase the power by about a factor of three and you increase the cost by only about 50% we do this all the time in the PC industry we add a GPU a $500 GPU gForce GPU to a $1,000 PC and the performance increases tremendously we do this in a data center a billion dooll data center we add $500 million worth of gpus and all of a sudden it becomes an AI Factory this is happening all over the world today well the savings are quite extraordinary you're getting 60 times performance per dollar a 100 times speed up you only increase your power by 3x 100 times speed up you only increase inre your cost by 1.5x the savings are incredible the savings are measured in dollars it is very clear that many many companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars processing data in the cloud if it was accelerated it is not unexpected that you could save hundreds of millions of dollars now why is that well the reason for that is very clear we've been experiencing inflation for so long in general purpose Computing now that we finally came to we finally determined to accelerate there's an enormous amount of captured loss that we can now regain a great deal of captured retained waste that we can now relieve out of the system and that will translate into savings Savings in money Savings in energy and that's the reason why you've heard me say the more you buy the more you save and now I've shown you the mathematics it is not accurate but it is correct okay that's called CEO math CEO math is not accurate but it is correct the more you buy the more you save well accelerated computing does deliver extraordinary results but it is not easy why is it that it saves so much money but people haven't done it for so long the reason for that is because it's incredibly hard there is no such thing as a software that you can just run through a c compiler and all of a sudden that application runs a 100 times faster that is not even logical if it was possible to do that they would have just changed the CPU to do that you in fact have to rewrite the software that's the hard part the software has to be completely Rewritten so that you could reactor reexpress the algorithms that was written on a CPU so that it could be accelerated offloaded accelerated and run in parallel that computer science exercise is insanely hard well we've made it easy for the world over the last 20 years of course the very famous cdnn the Deep learning library that processes neural networks we have a library for AI physics that you could use for fluid dynamics and many other applications where the neural network has to obey the laws of physics we have a great new library called aerial that is a Cuda accelerated 5G radio so that we can software Define and accelerate the Telecommunications networks the way that we've soft software defined the world world's networking um uh internet and so the ability for us to accelerate that allows us to turn all of Telecom into essentially the same type of platform a Computing platform just like we have in the cloud kitho is a comp computational lithography platform that allows us to uh process the most computationally intensive parts of Chip manufacturing making the mask tsmc is in the process of going to production with k litho saving enormous amounts of energy and more enormous amounts of money but the goal for tsmc is to accelerate their stack so that they're prepared for even further advances in algorithm and more computation for deeper and deeper uh narrow and narrow transistors parab brakes is our Gene sequencing Library it is the highest throughput library in the world for Gene sequencing coopt is an incredible library for combinatorial optimization route planning optimization the traveling salesman problem incredibly complicated people do people have well scientists have largely concluded that you needed a quantum computer to do that we created an algorithm that runs on accelerated Computing that runs Lightning Fast 23 World Records we hold every single major world record today C Quantum is an emulation system for a quantum computer if you want to design a quantum computer comp you need a simulator to do so if you want to design Quantum algorithms you need a Quantum emulator to do so how would you do that how would you design these quantum computers create these Quantum algorithms if the quantum computer doesn't exist while you use the fastest computer in the world that exist today and we call it of course Nvidia Cuda and on that we have an emulator that simulates quantum computers it is used by several hundred thousand researchers around the world it is integrated into all the leading M leading Frameworks for Quantum Computing and is used in scientific super super Computing centers all over the world kdf is an unbelievable library for data processing data processing consumes the vast majority of cloud spend today all of it should be accelerated qdf accelerates the major libraries used in the world spark many of you probably use spark in your companies pandas um a new one called polar and of course uh networkx which is a graph processing graph processing uh database um library and so these are just some examples there are so many more each one of them had to be created so that we can enable the ecosystem to take advantage of accelerated Computing if we hadn't created cudnn Cuda alone wouldn't have been able wouldn't have been possible for of the deep learning scientists around the world to use because Cuda and the algorithms that are used in tensor flow and Pi torch the Deep learning algorithms the separation is too far apart it's almost like trying to do computer Graphics without open G it's almost like doing data processing without SQL these domain specific libraries are really The Treasure of our company we have 350 of them the these libraries Is What It Takes and what has made it possible for us to have such open so many markets I'll show you some other examples today well just last week Google announced that theyve put CDF in the cloud and accelerate pandas pandas is the most popular data science library in the world many of you in here probably already use pandas it's used by 10 million data scientists in the world downloaded 170 million times each month it is the Excel that is the spreadsheet of data scientists well with just one click you can now use pandas in C collab which is Google's cloud data centers platform accelerated by CDF the speed up is really incredible let's take a look [Music] that was a great demo right didn't take [Applause] long when you accelerate data processing that fast demos don't take long okay well Cuda has now achieved what people call a Tipping Point but it's even better than that Cuda has now achieved a virtuous cycle this rarely happens if you look at history and all the Computing architecture Computing Platforms in the case of microprocessor CPUs it has been here for 60 years it has not been changed for 60 years at this level this way of doing Computing accelerated Computing has been around has creating a new platform is extremely hard because it's a chicken and egg problem if there are no developers that use your platform then of course there will be no users but if there are no users there are no install base if they're no install base developers aren't interested in it developers want to write software for a large install base but a large install base requires a lot of applications so that users would create that install base this chicken or the egg problem has rarely been broken and has taken us now 20 years one domain Library after another one acceleration Library another and now we have 5 million developers around the world we serve every single industry from Health Care Financial Services of course the computer industry automotive industry just about every major industry in the world just about every field of science because there are so many customers for our architecture oems and cloud service providers are interested in building our systems system makers am amazing system makers like the ones here in Taiwan are interested in building our systems which then takes and offers more systems to the market which of course creates greater opportunity for us which allows us to increase our scale R&D scale which speeds up the application even more well every single time we speed up the application the cost of computing goes down this is that slide I was showing you earlier 100x speed up translates to 97 96% 98% savings and so when we go from 100x speed up to 200x speed up to a000 X speed up the savings the marginal cost of computing continues to fall well of course we believe that by reducing the cost of computing incredibly the market developers scientists inventors will continue to discover new algorithms that cons consume more and more and more Computing so that one day something happens that a pH shift happens that the marginal cost of computing is so low that a new way of using computers emerge in fact that's what we're seeing now over the years we have driven down the marginal cost of computing in the last 10 years in one particular algorithm by a million times well as a result it is now very logical and very common sense to train large language models with all of the data on the internet nobody thinks twice this idea that you could create a computer that could process so much data to write its own software the emergence of artificial intelligence was made possible because of this complete belief that if we made Computing cheaper and cheaper and cheaper somebody's going to find a great use well today Cuda has achieved the virtual cycle install base is growing Computing cost is coming down which causes more developers to come up with more ideas which drives more demand and now we're on in the beginning of something very very important but before I show you that I want to show you what is not possible if not for the fact that we created Cuda that we created the modern version of General the modern Big Bang of AI generative AI what I'm about to show you would not be possible this is Earth two the idea that we would create a digital twin of the earth that we would go and simulate the Earth so that we could predict the future of our planet to better Aver disasters or better understand the impact of climate change so that we can adapt better so that we could change our habits now this digital twin of Earth is probably one of the most ambitious projects that the world's ever undertaken and we're taking step large steps every single year and I'll show you results every single year but this year we made some great breakthroughs let's take a look on Monday the storm will Veer North again and approach Taiwan there are big uncertainties regarding its path different paths will have different levels of impact on Taiwan forvia Earth [Music] [Music] 2f [Music] for fore cordi AI [Music] Nvidia [Music] [Music] [Applause] someday in the near future we will have continuous weather prediction at every at every Square kilometer on the planet you will always know what the climate's going to be you will always know and this will run continuously because we trained the AI and the AI requires so little energy and so this is just an incredible achievement I hope you you enjoyed it and very importantly uh what [Applause] the truth is that was a Jensen AI that was not me I I wrote I wrote it but an AI Jens AI had to say it because of our dedication to continuously improve the performance of Drive the cost down researchers discover discovered AI researchers discovered Cuda in 2012 that was nvidia's first contact with AI this was a very important day we had the good wisdom to work with the the scientists to make it possible for a deep learning to happen and Alex net achieved of course a tremendous computer vision breakthrough but the great wisdom was to take a step back and understanding what was the background what is the foundation of deep learning what is its long-term impact what is its potential and we realized that this technology has great potential to scale an algorithm that was invented and discovered decades ago all of a sudden because of more data larger networks and very importantly a lot more compute all of a sudden deep learning was able to achieve what no human algorithm was able to now imagine if we were to scale up the architecture even more larger networks more data and more compute what could be possible so we dedicated ourselves to reinvent everything after 2012 we changed the architecture of our GPU to add tensor course we invented MV link that was 10 years ago now CNN tensor RT nickel we bought melanox tensor RT LM the Triton inference server and all of it came together on a brand new computer nobody understood nobody asked for it nobody understood it and in fact I was certain nobody wanted to buy it and so we announced it at GTC and open AI a small company in San Francisco saw it and they asked me to deliver one to them I delivered the first dgx the F the world's first AI supercomputer to open AI in 2016 well after that we continued to scale from one AI supercomputer one AI Appliance we scaled it up to large supercomputers even larger by 2017 the world discovered Transformers so that we could train enormous amounts of data and recognize and learn patterns that are sequential over large spans of time it is now possible for for us to train these large language models to understand and achieve a breakthrough in natural language understanding and we kept going after that we built even larger ones and then in November 2022 trained on thousands tens of thousands of Nvidia gpus in a very large AI supercomputer open AI announced chat GPT 1 million users after five days 1 million after five days a 100 million after two months the fastest growing application in history and the reason for that is very simple it is just so easy to use and it was so magical to use to be able to interact with computer like it's Human Instead of being clear about what you want it's like the computer understands your meaning it understands your intention oh I think here it it um asked the the closest Night Market night as you know U the night market is very important to me so when I was young uh I was I think I was four and a half years old I used to love going to the night mark Market because I I just love watching people and and uh uh and so we went my parents used to take us to the night market uh and and um uh and I love I love U I love going and one day uh my face you guys might might see that I have a large scar on my face my face was cut because somebody was washing their knife and I was a little kid um but my memories of of the Night Market is uh so deep because of that and I used to love I I just I still love going to the night market and I just need to tell you guys this the the Tona Night Market is is really good because there's a lady uh she's been working there for 43 years she's the fruit lady and it's in the middle of the stre the middle between the two go find her okay she [Applause] she's really terrific I think it would be funny after this all of you go to see her she every year she's doing better and better her cart has improved and yeah I just love watching her succeed anyways anyways uh Chad GPT came along and um and something is very important in this slide here let me show you something this slide okay and this Slide the fundamental difference is this until chat GPT revealed it to the world AI was all about perception natural language understanding Compu computer vision speech recognition it's all about perception and detection this was the first time the world saw a generative AI It produced tokens one token at a time and those tokens were words some of the tokens of course could now be images or charts or tables songs words speech videos those tokens could be anything they anything that that you can learn the meaning of it could be tokens of chemicals tokens of proteins genes you saw earlier in Earth 2 we were generating tokens of the weather we can we can learn physics if you can learn physics you could teach an AI model physics the AI model could learn the meaning of physics and it can generate physics we were scaling down to 1 kilometer not by using filtering it was generating and so we can use this method to generate tokens for almost anything almost anything of value we can generate steering wheel control for a car we can generate articulation for a robotic arm everything that we can learn we can now generate we have now arrived not at the AI era but a generative AI era but what's really important is this this computer that started out as a supercomputer has now evolved into a Data Center and it produces one thing it produces tokens it's an AI Factory this AI Factory is generating creating producing something of Great Value a new commodity in the late 1890s Nicola Tesla invented an AC generator we invented an AI generator the AC generator generated electrons nvidia's AI generator generates tokens both of these things have large Market opportunities it's completely fungible in almost every industry and that's why it's a new Industrial Revolution we have now a new Factory producing a new commodity for every industry that is of extraordinary value and the methodology for doing this is quite scalable and the methodology of doing this is quite repeatable notice how quickly so many different AI models generative AI models are being invented literally daily every single industry is now piling on for the very first time the IT industry which is $3 trillion $3 trillion IT industry is about to create something that can directly serve a hundred trillion dollar of Industry no longer just an instrument for information storage or data processing but a factory for generating intelligence for every industry this is going to be a manufacturing industry not a manufacturing industry of computers but using the computers in manufacturing this has never happened before quite an extraordinary thing what led started with accelerated comp Computing led to AI led to generative Ai and now an industrial revolution now the impact to our industry is also quite significant of course we could create a new commodity a new product we call tokens for many Industries but the impact of ours is also quite profound for the very first time as I was saying earlier in 60 years every single layer of computing has been changed from CPUs general purpose Computing to accelerated GPU Computing where the computer needs instructions now computers process llms large language models AI models and whereas the Computing model of the past is retrieval based almost every time you touch your phone some pre-recorded text or pre-recorded image or pre-recorded video is retrieved for you and recomposed based on a recommender system to present it to you based on your habits but in the future your computer will generate as much as possible retrieve only what's necessary and the reason for that is because generated generated data requires less energy to go fetch information generated data also is more contextually relevant it will encode knowledge it will your understanding of you and instead of get that inform information for me or get that file for me you just say ask me for an answer and instead of a tool instead of your computer being a tool that we use the computer will now generate skills it performs tasks and instead of an industry that is producing software was which was a revolu evolutionary idea in the early 90s remember the idea that Microsoft created for packaging software revolutionize the PC industry without packaged software what would we use the PC to do it drove this industry and now we have a new Factory a new computer and what we will run on top of this is a new type of software and we call it Nims Nvidia inference microservices now what what happens is the Nim runs inside this Factory and this Nim is a pre-trained model it's an AI well this AI is of course quite complex in itself but the the Computing stack that runs AIS are insanely complex when you go and use chat GPT underneath their stack is a whole bunch of software underneath that prompt is a ton of software and it's incredibly complex because the models are large billions to trillions of parameters it doesn't run on just one computer it runs on multiple computers it has to distribute the workload across multiple gpus tensor parallelism pipeline parallelism data parallel all kinds of parallelism expert parallelism all kinds of parallelism Distributing the workload across multiple gpus processing it as fast as possible because if you are in a factory if you run a factory your throughput directly correlates to your revenues your throughput directly correlates to quality of service and your throughput directly correlates to number of people who can use your service we are now in a world where data center throughput utilization is vitally important it was important in the past but not Vally important it was important in the past but people don't measure it today every par parameter is measured start time uptime utilization throughput idle time you name it because it's a factory when something is a factory its operations directly correlate to the financial performance of the company and so we realized that this is incredibly complex for most companies to do so what we did was we created this AI in a box and it containers an incredible amounts of software inside this container is Cuda cudnn tensor RT Triton for inference Services it is cloud native so that you could Auto scale in a kubernetes environment it has Management Services and hooks so that you can monitor your AIS it has common apis standard apis so that you could literally chat with this box you download this Nim and you can talk to it so long as you have Cuda on your computer which is now of course everywhere it's in every cloud available from every computer maker it is available in hundreds of millions of PCS when you download this you have an AI and you can chat with it like chat GPT all of the software is now integrated 400 dependencies all integrated into one we tested this Nim each one of these pre-trained models against all kind are Tire install base that's in the cloud all the different versions of Pascal and ampers and Hoppers and all kinds of different versions I even forget some Nims incredible invention this is one of my favorites and of course as you know we now have the ability to create large language models and pre-trained models of all kinds and we we have all of these various versions whether it's language based or Vision based or Imaging based or we have versions that are available for healthc care digital biology we have versions that are digital humans that I'll talk to you about and the way you use this just come to ai. nvidia.com and today we uh just posted up in hugging face the Llama 3 Nim fully optimized it's available there for you to try and you can even take it with you it's available to you for free and so you could run it in the cloud run it in any Cloud you could download this container put it into your own Data Center and you could host it make it available for your customers we have as I mentioned all kinds of different domains physics some of it is for semantic retrieval called Rags Vision languages all kinds of different languages and the way that you use it is connecting these microservices into large applications one of the most important applications in the coming future of course is customer service agents customer service agents are necessary in just about every single industry it represents trillions of dollars of of customer service around the world nurses are customer service agents um in some ways some of them are nonprescription or or non Diagnostics um based nurses are essentially customer service uh customer service for retail for uh Quick Service Foods Financial Services Insurance just tens and tens of millions of customer service can now be augmented by language models and augumented by Ai and so these one these boxes that you see are basically Nims some of the NIMS are reasoning agents given a task figure out what the miss is break it down into a plan some of the NIMS retrieve information some of the NIMS might uh uh uh go and do search some of the NIMS uh might use a tool like kuop that I was talking about earlier they could use a tool that uh could be running on sap and so it has to learn a particular uh language called abap maybe some Nims have to uh uh do SQL queries and so all of these Nims are experts that are now assembled as a team so what's happening the application layer has been changed what used to be applications written with instructions are now applications that are assembling teams assembling teams of AIS very few people know how to write programs almost everybody knows how to break down a problem and assemble teams very every company I believe in the future will have a large collection of Nims and you would bring down the experts that you want you connect them into a team and you you don't even have to figure out exactly how to connect them you just give the mission to an agent to a Nim to figure out who to break the task down and who to give it to and they that a that Central the leader of the of the application if you will the leader of the team would break down the task and give it to the various team members the team members would do their perform their task bring it back to the team leader the team leader would reason about that and present an information back to you just like humans this is in our near future this is the way applications are going to look now of course we could interact with these large these AI services with text prompts and speech prompts however there are many applications where we would like to interact with what what is otherwise a humanlike form we call them digital humans Nvidia has been working on digital human technology for some time let me show it to you and well before I do that hang on a second before I do that okay digital humans has the potential of being a great interact Interactive with you they make much more engaging they could be much more empathetic and of course um we have to uh uh cross this incredible Chasm this uncanny Chasm of realism so that the digital humans would appear much more natural this is of course our vision this is a vision of where we love to go uh but let me show you where we are great to be in Taiwan before I head out to the night market let's dive into some exciting frontiers of digital humans imagine a future where computers interact with us just like humans can hi my name is Sophie and I am a digital human brand ambassador for Unique this is the incredible reality of digital humans digital humans will revolutionize industries from customer service to advertising and ging the possibilities for digital humans are endless using the scans you took of your current kitchen with your phone they will be AI interior designers helping generate beautiful photorealistic suggestions and sourcing the materials and Furniture we have generated several design options for you to choose from they'll also be AI customer service agents making the interaction more engaging and personalized or digital healthcare workers who will check on patients providing Timely personalized care um I did forget to mention to the doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications the antibiotics you've been prescribed cicin and metronidazol don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them and they'll even be AI brand ambassadors setting the next marketing and advertising Trends hi I'm EMA Japan's first virtual model new breakthroughs in generative Ai and computer Graphics let digital humans see understand and interact with us in humanlike ways H from what I can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup the foundation of digital humans are AI models built on multilingual speech recognition and synthesis and llms that understand and generate conversation the AIS connect to another generative AI to dynamically animate a lifelike 3D mesh of a face and finally AI models that reproduce lifelike appearances enabling real-time path traced subsurface scattering to simulate the way light penetrates the skin scatters and exits at various points giving skin its soft and translucent appearance Nvidia Ace is a suite of digital human Technologies packaged as easy to deploy fully optimized microservices or Nims developers can integrate Ace Nims into their existing Frameworks engines and digital human experiences neotron slm and llm Nims to understand our intent and orchestrate other models Reva speech Nims for interactive speech and translation audio to face and gesture Nims for facial and body animation an Omniverse RTX with dlss for neuro rendering of skin and hair Ace Nims run on Nvidia gdn a Global Network of Nvidia accelerated infrastructure that delivers low latency digital human processing to over 100 regions Kaa [Applause] pretty incredible well those those Ace runs in a cloud but it also runs on PCS we had the good wisdom of including tensor core gpus in all of RTX so we've been shipping AI gpus for some time preparing ourselves for this day the reason for that is very simple we always knew that in order to create a new Computing platform you need to install Bas first eventually the application will come if you don't create the install base how could the application come and so if you build it they might not come but if you build it if you don't build it they cannot come and so we installed every single RTX GPU with tensor core G tensor core processing and now we have 100 million GeForce RTX AIP PCS in the world and we're shipping 200 and this this compy Tex wor featuring four new amazing laptops all of them are able to run AI your future laptop your future PC will become an AI it'll be constantly helping you assisting you in the background the PC will also run applications that are enhanced by AI of course all your photo editing and your writing and your tools all the things that you use will all be enhanced by Ai and your PC will also host applications with digital humans that are AIS and so there are different ways that AIS will manifest themselves and become used in PCS but PCS will become very important AI platform and so where do we go from here I spoke earlier about the scaling of our data centers and every single time we scaled we found a new phase change when we scaled from dgx into large AI supercomputers we enabled Transformers to be able to train on enormously large data data sets well what happened was in the beginning the data was human supervised it required human labeling to train AIS unfortunately there is only so much you can human label Transformers made it possible for unsupervised learning to happen now Transformers just look at an enormous amount of data or look at enormous amount of video or look at enormous amount of uh images and it can learn from studying an enormous amount of data find the patterns and relationships itself while the next generation of AI needs to be physically based most of the AIS today uh don't understand the laws of physics it's not grounded in the physical world in order for us to generate uh uh images and videos and 3D graphics and many physics phenomenons we need AIS that are physically based and understand the laws of physics well the way that you could do that is of course learning from video is One Source another way is synthetic data simulation data and another way is using computers to learn with each other this is really no different than using alphao having alphao play itself selfplay and between the two capabilities same capabilities playing each other for a very long period of time they emerge even smarter and so you're going to start to see this type of AI emerging well if the AI data is synthetically generated and using reinforcement learning it stands to reason that the rate of data generation will continue to advance and every single time data generation grows the amount of computation that we have to offer needs to grow with it we are about to enter a phase where AIS can learn the laws of physics and understand and be grounded in physical world data and so we expect that models will continue to grow and we need larger gpus well Blackwell was designed for this generation this is Blackwell and has several very important Technologies uh one of course is just the size of the chip we took two of the largest a chip that is as large as you can make it at tsmc and we connected two of them together with a 10 terabytes per second link between the world's most advanced cies connecting these two together we then put two of them on a computer node connected with a gray CPU the gray CPU could be used for several things in the training situation it could use it could be used for fast checkpoint and restart in the case of inference and generation could be used for storing context memory so that the AI has memory and understands uh the context of the the conversation you would like to have it's our second generation Transformer engine Transformer engine allows us to adapt dynamically to a lower precision based on the Precision and the range necessary for that layer of computation uh this is our second generation GPU that has secure AI so that you could you could ask your service provider to protect your AI from being either stolen from theft or tampering this is our fifth generation MV link MV link allows us to connect multiple gpus together and I'll show you more of that in a second and this is also our first generation with a reliability and availability engine this system this Ras system allows us to test every single transistor flip-flop memory on chip memory off chip so that we can in the field determine whether a particular chip is uh failing the mtbf the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 10,000 gpus is a measured in hours the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 100,000 gpus is measured in minutes and so the ability for a supercomputer to run for a long period of time and train a model that could last for several months is practically impossible if we don't invent Technologies to enhance its reliability reliability would of course enhance its uptime which directly affects the cost and then lastly decompression engine data processing is one of the most important things we have to do we added a data compression engine decompression engine so that we can pull data out of storage 20 times faster than what's possible today well all of this repres presents Blackwell and I think we have one here that's in production during GTC I showed you Blackwell in a prototype State um the other side this is why we practice [Laughter] ladies and gentlemen this is Blackwell black Blackwell is in production incredible amounts of Technology this is our production board this is the most complex highest performance computer the world's ever made this is the great CPU and these are you could see each one of these blackw dieses two of them connected together you see that it is the largest die the largest chip the world makes and then we connect two of them together with a 10 terabyte per second link okay and that makes the Blackwell computer and the performance is incredible take a look at this so um you see you see our uh the the computational the flops the AI flops uh for each generation has increased by a thousand times in eight years Mo's law in eight years is something along the lines of oh I don't know maybe 40 60 and in the last eight years Moors law has gone a lot lot less and so just to compare even Moors law at its best of times compared to what Blackwell could do so the amount of computations is incredible and when whenever we bring the computation High the thing that happens is the cost goes down and I'll show you what we've done is we've increased through its computational capability the energy used to train a gp4 2 trillion parameter 8 trillion Tokens The amount of energy that is used has gone down by 350 times Well Pascal would have taken 1,000 gwatt hours 1,000 gwatt hours means that it would take a gigawatt data center the world doesn't have a gigawatt data center but if you had a gigawatt data center it would take a month if you had 100 watt 100 megawatt data center it would take about a year and so nobody would of course um uh create such a thing and um and that's the reason why these large language models chat GPT was impossible only eight years ago by us driving down the increasing the performance the energy efficent while keeping and improving energy efficent efficiency along the way we've now taken with Blackwell what used to be 1,000 gwatt hours to three an incredible Advance uh 3 gwatt hours if it's a if it's a um uh uh a 10,000 gpus for example it would only take a coule 10,000 gpus I guess it would take a few days 10 days or so so the amount of advance in just eight years is incredible well this is for inference this is for token generation Our token generation performance has made it possible for us to drive the energy down by three 45,000 times 177,000 Jewels per token that was Pascal 177,000 Jewels it's kind of like two light bulbs running for two days it would take two light bulbs running for two days amounts of energy 200 Watts running for two days to generate one token of gp4 it takes about three tokens to generate one word and so the amount of energy used necessary for Pascal to generate gp4 and have a chat GPT experience with you was practically impossible but now we only use 0.4 Jew per token and we can generate tokens at incredible rates and very little energy okay so Blackwell is just an enormous lead well even so it's not big enough and so we have to build even larger machines and so the way that we build it is called dgx so this is this is our Blackwell chips and it goes into dgx systems that's why we should practice so this is a dgx Blackwell this has this is air cooled has eight of these gpus inside look at the size of the heat sinks on these gpus about 15 kilowatt 15,000 watts and completely air cooled this version supports x86 and it's it goes into the infrastructure that we've been shipping Hoppers into however if you you would like to have liquid cooling we have a new system and this new system is based on this board and we call it mgx for modular and this modular system you won't be able to see this this can they see this can you see this you can the are you okay I say and so this is the mgx system and here's the two uh black Blackwell boards so this one node has four Blackwell chips these four Blackwell chips this is liquid cooled nine of them nine of them uh well 72 of these 72 of these gpus 72 of these G gpus are then connected together with a new MV link this is MV link switch fifth generation and the mvlink switch is a technology Miracle this is the most advanced switch the world's ever made the data rate is insane and these switches connect every single one of these black Wells to each other so that we have one giant 72 GPU Blackwell well the benefit the benefit of this is that in one domain one GPU domain this now looks like one GPU this one GPU has 72 versus the last generation of eight so we increased it by nine times the amount of bandwidth we've increased by 18 times the AI flops we've increased by 45 times and yet the amount of power is only 10 times this is 100 kilowatt and that is 10 kilow and that's for one now of course well you could always connect more of these together and I'll show you how to do that in a second but what's the miracle is this chip this MV link chip people are starting to awaken to the importance of this mvlink chip as it connects all these different gpus together because the large language models are so large it doesn't fit on just one GPU doesn't fit on one just just one node it's going to take the entire rack of gpus like this new dgx that I that I was just standing next to uh to to hold a large language model that are tens of trillions of parameters large mvlink which in itself is a technology Miracle is 50 billion transistors 74 ports at 400 gbits each four lengths cross-sectional bandwidth of 7 7.2 terabytes per second but one of the important things is that it has mathematics inside the switch so that we can do reductions which is really important in deep learning right on the Chip And so this is what this is what um a dgx looks like now and a lot of people ask us um you know they say and there's this there's this confusion about what Nvidia does and and um how is it possible that that Nvidia became so big building gpus and so there's an impression that this is what a GPU looks like now this is a GPU this is one of the most advanced gpus in the world but this is a gamer GPU but you and I know that this is what a GPU looks like this is one GPU ladies and gentlemen dgx GPU you know the back of this GPU is the MV link spine the MV link spine is 5,000 wires two miles and it's right here this is an mvlink spine and it connects 702 gpus to each other this is a electrical mechanical Miracle the transceivers makes it possible for us to drive the entire length in Copper and as a result this switch the mvy switch mvlink switch driving the mvlink spine in Copper makes it possible for us to save 20 kilow in one rack 20 kilowatts could now be used for processing just an incredible achievement so this is the the MV links [Applause] spine wow I went down today and if you and even this is not big enough even this is not big enough for AI factories so we have to connect it all together with very high-speed networking well we have two types of networking we have infin band which has been used uh in supercomputing and AI factories all over the world and it is growing incredibly fast for us however not every data center can handle infiniband because they've already invested their ecosystem in Ethernet for too long and it does take some specialty and some expertise to manage infiniband switches and infiniband networks and so what we've done is we've brought the capabilities of infiniband to the ethernet architecture which is incredibly hard and the reason for that is this ethernet was designed for high average throughput because every single note every single computer is connected to a different person on the internet and most of the communications is the data center with somebody on the other side of the internet however deep learning in AI factories the gpus are not communicating with people on the internet mostly it's communicating with each other they're communicating with each other because they're all they're collecting partial products and they have to reduce it and then redistribute it chunks of partial products reduction redistribution that traffic is incredibly bursty and it is not the average throughput that matters it's the last arrival that matters because if you're reducing collecting partial products from everybody if I'm trying to take all of your so it's not the average throughput it's whoever gives me the answer last okay ethernet has no provision for that and so there are several things that we had to create we created an endtoend architecture so that the the Nick and the switch can communicate and we applied four different Technologies to make this possible number one Nvidia has the world's most advanced RDMA and so now we have the ability to have a network level RDMA for ethernet that is incredibly great number two we have congestion control the switch does Telemetry at all times incredibly fast and whenever the uh the uh the the gpus or the the Nyx are sending too much information we can tell them to back off so that it doesn't create hotspots number three adaptive routing ethernet needs to transmit and receive in order we see congestions or we see uh ports that are not currently being used irrespective of the ordering we will send it to the available ports and Bluefield on the other end reorders it so that it comes back in order that adaptive routing incredibly powerful and then lastly noise isolation there's more than one model being trained or something happening in the data center at all times and their noise and their traffic could get into each other and causes Jitter and so when it when the noise of one training model one model training causes the last arrival to end up too late it really slows down to training well overall remember you have you have built A5 billion dollar or3 billion doll Data Center and you're using this for training if the utilization Network utilization was 40% lower and as a result the training time was 20% longer the5 billion data center is effectively like a$6 billion doll data center so the cost is incredible the cost impact is quite High ethernet with Spectrum X basically allows us to improve the performance so much that the network is basically free and so this is really quite an achievement we're very we have a whole pipeline of ethernet products behind us this is Spectrum x800 it is uh 51.2 terabits per second and 256 radic the next one coming is 512 radic is one year from now 512 Radix and that's called Spectrum x800 Ultra and the one after that is x1600 but the important idea is this x800 is designed for tens of thousands tens T of thousands of gpus x800 ultra is designed for hundreds of thousands of gpus and x1600 is designed for millions of gpus the days of millions of GPU data centers are coming and the reason for that is very simple of course we want to train much larger models but very importantly in the future almost every interaction you have with the Internet or with a computer will likely have a generative AI running in the cloud somewhere and that generative AI is working with you interacting with you generating videos or images or text or maybe a digital human and so you're interacting with your computer almost all the time and there's always a generative AI connected to that some of it is on Prem some of it is on your device and a lot of it could be in the cloud these generative AIS will also do a lot of reasoning capability instead of just one shot answer they might iterate on answers so that it improve the quality of the answer before they give it to you and so the amount of generation we're going to do in the future is going to be extraordinary let's take a look at all of this put together now tonight this is our first nighttime keyote I want to thank I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight at 7:00 and and so what I'm about to show you has a new Vibe okay there's a new Vibe this is kind of the nighttime keynote Vibe so enjoy this black [Music] let's go go go go go okay [Music] [Music] [Music] come on yeah yeah yeah yeah get it y get it y let's go [Music] [Applause] the more you back the more you sa with top ey Tor made that's to speed a [Music] [Applause] now you can't do that on a morning keynote I think that style of keynote has never been done in compy Tex ever might be the last only Nvidia can pull off that only I could do that [Applause] Blackwell of course uh is the first generation of Nvidia platforms that was launched at the beginning at the right as the world knows the generative AI era is here just as the world realized the importance of AI factories just as the beginning of this new Industrial Revolution uh we have so much support nearly every OEM every computer maker every CSP every GPU Cloud Sovereign clouds even telecommunication companies Enterprises all over the world the amount of success the amount of adoption the amount of of uh enthusiasm for Blackwell is just really off the charts and I want to thank everybody for that we're not stopping there uh during this during the time of this incredible growth we want to make sure that we continue to enhance performance continue to drive down cost cost of training cost of inference and continue to scale out AI capabilities for every company to embrace the further we the further performance we drive up the Greater the cost decline Hopper platform of course was the most successful data center processor probably in history and this is just an incredible incredible success story however Blackwell is here and every single platform as you'll notice are several things you got the CPU you have the GPU you have MV link you have the Nick and you have the switch the the mvlink switch the uh connects all of the gpus together as large of a domain as we can and whatever we can do we connect it with large um very large and very highspeed switches every single generation as you'll see is not just a GPU but it's entire platform we build the entire platform we integrate the entire platform into an AI Factory supercomputer however then we this aggregate it and offer it to the world and the reason for that is because all of you could create interesting and Innovative configurations and and and all kinds of different uh uh Styles and and fit different uh data centers and different customers in different places some of it for Edge some of it for Telco and all of the different Innovation are POS possible if it would we made the systems open and make it possible for you to innovate and so we design it integrated but we offer it to you disintegrated so that you could create modular systems the Blackwell platform is here our company is on a one-year Rhythm we our basic philosophy is very simple one build the entire data center scale disaggregated and sell it to you in Parts on a one-year Rhythm and we push everything the technology limits whatever tsmc process technology will push it to the absolute limits whatever packaging technology push it to the absolute limits whatever memory technology push it to Absolute limits series technology Optics technology everything is pushed to the Limit well and then after that do everything in such a way so that all of our software runs on this entire install base software inertia is the single most important thing in computers it'll when a computer is backwards compatible and it's architecturally compatible with all the software that has already been created your ability to go to market is so much faster and so the velocity is incredible when we can take advantage of the entire installed base of software has already been created well Blackwell is here next year is Blackwell Ultra just as we had h100 and h200 you'll probably see some pretty exciting New Generation from us for black Blackwell Ultra again again push to the limits and the Next Generation Spectrum switches I mentioned well this is the very first time that this next click has been made and I'm not sure yet whe I'm going to regret this or [Applause] not we have code names in our company and uh we try to keep them very secret uh often times uh most of the employees don't even know but our next Generation platform is called Reuben the Reuben platform the Reuben platform um I'm I'm not going to spend much time on it uh I know what's going to happen you're going to take pictures of it and you're going to go look at the fine prints uh and feel free to do that so we have the Reuben platform and one year later we' have the Reuben um Ultra platform all of these chips that I'm showing you here are all in full development 100% of them and the rhythm is one year at the limits of Technology all 100% architecturally compatible so this is this is basically what Nvidia is building and all of the riches of software on top of it so in a lot of ways the last 12 years from that moment of imag net and US realizing that the future of computing was going to radically change to today is really exactly as I was holding up earlier GeForce pre 20102 and Nvidia today the company has really transformed tremendously and I want to thank all of our partners here for supporting us every step along the way this is the Nvidia black wall platform let me talk about what's next the next wave of AI is physical AI AI that understands the laws of physics AI that can work among us and so they have to understand the world model so that they understand how to interpret the world how to perceive the world they have to of course have excellent cognitive capabilities so they can understand us understand what we asked and perform the tasks in the future robotics is a much more p pervasive idea of course when I say robotics there's a humanoid robotics that's usually the representation of that but that's not at all true everything is going to be robotic all of the factories will be robotic the factories will orchestrate robots and those robots will be building products that are robotic robots interacting with robots building products that are robotic well in order for us to do that we need to make some breakthroughs and let me show you the video the era of Robotics has arrived one day everything that moves will be autonomous researchers and companies around the world are developing robots powered by physical AI physical AIS are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world multimodal llms are breakthroughs that enable robots to learn perceive and understand the world around them and plan how they'll act and from Human demonstrations robots can now learn the skills required to interact with the world using gross and fine motor skills one of the integral Technologies for advancing robotics is reinforcement learning just as llms need rhf or reinforcement learning from Human feedback to learn particular skills generative physical AI can learn skills using reinforcement learning from physics feedback in a simulated World these simulation environments are where robots learn to make decisions by performing actions in a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics in these robot gyms a robot can learn to perform complex and dynamic tasks safely and quickly refining their skills through millions of Acts of trial and error we built Nvidia Omniverse as the operating system where physical a can be created Omniverse is a development platform for virtual world simulation combining realtime physically based rendering physics simulation and generative AI Technologies in Omniverse robots can learn how to be robots they learn how to autonomously manipulate objects with Precision such as grasping and handling objects or navigate environments autonomously finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles and Hazards learning in Omniverse minimizes the Sim to real Gap and maximizes the transfer of learned beh Behavior building robots with generative physical AI requires three computers Nvidia AI supercomputers to train the models Nvidia Jetson Orin and Next Generation Jetson Thor robotic supercomputer to run the models an Nvidia Omniverse where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds we build the platforms acceleration libraries and AI models needed by developers and companies and allow them to use any or all of the stacks that suit them best the next wave of AI is here robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize [Music] Industries this isn't the future this is happening now there are several ways that we're going to serve the market the first we're going to create platforms for each type of robotic systems one for robotic factories and warehouses one for robots that manipulate things one for robots that move and one for uh robots that are humanoid and so each one of these robotic robotics platform is like almost everything else we do a computer acceler libraries and pre-train models computers acceleration libraries pre-train models and we test everything we train everything and integrate everything inside Omniverse where Omniverse is as the video was saying where robots learn how to be robots now of course the ecosystem of robotic warehouses is really really complex it takes a lot of companies a lot of tools a lot of technology to build a modern warehouse and warehouses are increasingly robotic one of these things days will be fully robotic and so in each one of these ecosystems we have sdks and apis that are connected into the software industry sdks and apis connected into Edge AI industry um and companies and then also of course uh systems that are designed for plc's and robotic systems for the odms it's then integrated by integrators uh created for ultimately uh building warehouses uh for customers here we have an example of kenmac building a robotic warehouse for giant giant group okay and then here now let's talk about factories factories has a completely different ecosystem and foxcon is building some of the world's most advanced factories their ecosystem again Edge Computers and Robotics software for designing the factories the workflows programming the robots and of course PLC computers that orchestrate uh the digital factories and the AI factories we have sdks uh that are connected into each one of these ecosystems as well this is happening all over Taiwan foxcon has buil is building digital twins of their factories Delta is building digital twins of their factories by the way half is real half half is digital half is Omniverse pegatron is building digital twins of their robotic factories wistron is building digital twins of their robotic factories and this is really cool this is a video of foxc con's new Factory let's take a look demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing is skyrocketing as the World modernizes traditional data centers into generative AI factories foxcon the world's largest electronics manufacturer is gearing up to meet this Demand by building robotic factories with Nvidia Omniverse and AI Factory planners use Omniverse to integrate facility and Equipment data from leading industry applications like seamen team Center X and Autodesk Revit in the digital twin they optimize floor layout and line configurations and locate optimal camera placements to monitor future operations with Nvidia Metropolis powered Vision AI virtual integration saves planners on the enormous cost of physical change orders during construction the foxcon teams use the digital twin as the source of Truth to communicate and validate accurate equipment layout the Omniverse digital twin is also the robot gym where foxcon developers train and test Nvidia ISAC AI applications for robotic perception and manipulation and Metropolis AI applications for Sensor Fusion in Omniverse foxcon simulates two robot AIS before deploying run times to Jets and computers on the assembly line they simulate Isaac manipulator libraries and AI models for automated Optical inspection for object identification defect detection and trajectory planning to transfer hgx systems to the test pods they simulate Isaac perceptor powered fobot amrs as they perceive and move about their environment with 3D mapping and reconstruction with Omniverse foxcon builds their robotic factories that orchestrate robots running on Nvidia ISAC to build Nvidia AI supercomputers which which in turn train boxon [Music] [Applause] robots so a robotic Factory is designed with three computers train the AI on Nvidia AI you have the robot running on the PLC systems uh for orchestrating the the the uh the factories and then you of course simulate everything inside Omniverse well the robotic arm and the robotic amrs are also the same way three computer systems the difference is the two omniverses will come together so they'll share one virtual space when they share one virtual space that robotic arm will become inside the robotic Factory and again three three uh three computers and we provide the computer the acceleration layers and pre-train uh pre-train AI models we've connected Nvidia manipulator and Nvidia Omniverse with Seamans the world's leading Industrial Automation software and systems company this is really a fantastic partnership and they're working on factories all over the world semantic pick aai now integrates Isaac manipulator and sematic pick AI uh runs operates ABB CA yasawa uh Fook uh Universal robotics um and techman and so semmens is a fantastic integration we have all kinds of other Integrations let's take a look arcbest is integrating Isaac perceptor into Vox smart autonomy robots for enhanced object recognition and human motion tracking in Material Handling byd Electronics is integrating Isaac manipulator and percep ctor into their AI robots to enhance manufacturing efficiencies for Global customers ideal works is building Isaac perceptor into their iwos software for AI robots in Factory Logistics intrinsic an alphabet company is adopting Isaac manipulator into their Flow State platform to advance robot grasping Gideon is integrating Isaac perceptor into Trey AI powered forklifts to advance AI enabled Logistics Argo robotics is adopting Isaac perceptor into perception engine for Advanced Vision based amrs Solomon is using Isaac manipulator AI models in their acup piic 3D software for industrial manipulation techman robot is adopting Isaac Sim and manipulator into TM flow accelerating automated Optical inspection pteridine robotics is integrating Isaac manipulator into po scope X for cobots and Isaac perceptor into mere amrs vention is integrating Isaac manipulator into machine Logic for AI manipulation [Music] robots robotics is here physical AI is here this is not science fiction and it's being used all over Taiwan and just really really exciting and that's the factory the robots inside and of course all the products are going to be robotics there are two very high volume robotics products one of course is the self-driving car or cars that have a great deal of autonomous capability Nvidia again builds the entire stack next year we're going to go to production with the Mercedes Fleet and after that in 2026 the jlr fleet uh we offer the full stack to the world however you're welcome to take whichever Parts uh which whichever layer of our stack just as the entire the entire uh uh Drive stack is open the next high volume robotics product that's going to be manufactured by robotic factories with robots inside will likely be humanoid robots and this has great progress in recent years in both the cognitive capability because of foundation models and also the world understanding capability that we're in the process of developing I'm really excited about this area because obviously the easiest robot to adapt into the world are human or robots because we built the world for us we also have the vast the most amount of data to train these robots than other types of robots because we have the same uh physique and so the amount of training data we can provide through demonstration capabilities and video capabilities is going to be really great and so we're going to see a lot of progress in this area well I think we have um some robots that we' like to uh welcome there we go about my [Applause] size and we have we have some friends to join us so the fut the future of robot robotics is here the next wave of AI and and of course you know Taiwan builds computers with keyboards you build computers for your pocket you build computers for data centers in the cloud in the future you're going to build computers that walk and computers that roll you know around and um so these are all just computers and as as it turns out uh the technology is very similar to the technology of building um all of the other computers that you already build today so this is going to be a really extraordinary uh Journey for us well uh I want to thank I want to I want to thank I want to I have I've I've made one last video if you don't mind uh something that that uh uh uh we we really enjoyed making um and if you let's run it [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you I love you guys thank [Applause] you thank you all for coming have a great comput text thank [Applause] you I will make you like me yeah singing with me [Music] once again a come T we will show you all about best yeah digital dreams and me with to all of in Tai we hope that you like this song yeah good me and [Music] [Music] once get thank you for joining us yeah digal Twins and me we been I [Music] feeled hey I am awake for the new day feeling the sun upon my face I'm all the bad vibes away look to the sky I have this moment inside the glove I am the Sun up so high above I am the star you are thinking know take a minute now take a minute to see take a minute now we are put in the SE this is everything that I could ever KN on the top again in the land of the free and e e e hello everyone welcome sigraph it is my first sigraph I'm so excited to be here I'm so excited to speak to all of you and I'm so excited to speak to Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen hang great to see you again thank you great to see you welcome to sigraph Lauren Welcome To My Hood you're regular here huh hey everybody great to see you guys Jensen it is like 99 degrees outside I know it's freezing in here isn't it I mean I don't know I'm shaking leather jacket yeah feels great looks good too all right so you have I'm wearing a brand new one oh a brand new one yeah how many of those do you have I don't know but Lori got me a new one for sigraph she said you're excited about cigar here's a new jacket go go do good job I look sharp thank you all right uh you have a long history of sigraph I mean when you think about the history of this conference which has been going on since 1974 and you think about the history of Nvidia from the 1990s onward where your DNA was really in you know know computer Graphics uh helping to make beautiful Graphics what is the significance of Nvidia being here today right now at a conference like sigraph well you know uh sigraph used to be about computer Graphics now it's about computer graphics and generative AI it's about simulation it's about generative Ai and and we all know that the Journey of Nvidia which started out in computer Graphics as you said um uh really brought us here and so I made a cartoon for you I made a cartoon for you of our journey did you make it or did J of AI make it I I I had it hang on a second I had it made I had it made um that's what CEOs do we don't do anything we just have it be done it kind of starts something like this hey guys would it be great if we had a cartoon and it Illustrated some of the most important milestones in the computer industry and how it led to Nvidia and where we are today and and so we Illustrated and also do it in three hours and do three hours right and and so this is this cartoon here is really terrific so these are some of the some of the most important moments in the computer industry uh the IBM system 360 of course the invention of modern Computing uh the teapot 1975 the Utah teapot 1979 Ray tracing um uh Turner wited uh one of the great researchers Nvidia researcher for a long time uh 1986 programmable shading uh of course uh most of the animated movies that we see today wouldn't be possible if not for programmable shading originally done on the CRA supercomputer uh led to uh what and then in 1993 Nvidia was founded Chris Curtis and I founded the company 19 1995 Windows PC revolutionized uh the personal computer industry uh put a personal computer in every home and every desk uh multimedia PC was uh was invented 2001 we invented uh the first programmable shading GPU and and that that really uh drove uh vast majority of nvidia's Journey up to that point But at the background of everything we were doing was accelerated computing and accelerate and and we believe that you could create a type of computing model that could augment the general purpose Computing so that you can solve problems that normal computers can't and the application we chose first was computer graphics and it was probably one of the best decisions we ever made because computer Graphics was insanely computationally in intensive and remained so uh for the entire 31 years that that Nvidia has been here and since the beginning of computer Graphics in fact required a crazy supercomputer to render some of the original scenes so it kind of tells you how computationally intensive it was and it was also incredibly high volume because we applied computer Graphics to an application at the time that uh wasn't mainstream 3D Graphics video games the combination of very large volume very complicated Computing problem led to a very large R&D budget for us which drove the flywheel of our company that observation we made in 1993 was spoton and it led us to be able to Pioneer the work that we're doing in accelerated Computing we tried it many times Cuda was of course the Revolutionary version but prior to that we had a Computing model we call CG C for graphics C on top of gpus and so we've been working on accelerated Computing for a long time uh promoting and evangelizing Cuda getting Cuda everywhere and putting on every single one of our gpus so that this computing model was compatible with the with any application that was written for it irrespective of which generation of our processors that was a great decision and one one day in 2012 we made our first Contact you know Star Trek first Contact with artificial intelligence that first Contact was alexnet it was in 2012 very big moment uh we made the observation that alexnet was an incredible breakthrough in computer vision but at the core of it deep learning was deeply profound that it was a new way of writing software instead of Engineers given input imagining what the output was going to be write algorithms we now have a computer that given an input and example outputs would figure out what the program is in the middle that observation and that we can use this technique to solve a whole bunch of problems that previously wasn't solvable was a great observation and we changed everything in our company to pursue it from the processor to the systems to the software stack all the algorithms Nvidia basic research pivoted towards working on deep learning uh by the way this is a great place for research as you know nvidia's uh passionate about about uh uh sigraph and this year we have 20 papers that are at the intersection of generative Ai and simulation and so in 20 2016 uh we introduced the first computer we built for deep learning and we called it djx1 and I delivered the first djx1 outside of our company I built it for NVIDIA to build models for self-driving cars and Robotics and such and and generative AI for graphics uh but we uh somebody saw an example of djx1 Elon reached out to me and said hey I would love to have one of those for a startup company we're starting and so I delivered the first one to a company at the time uh that knew nobody knew about called open a I and so that was 2016 uh 2017 was the Transformer uh that revolutionized modern uh machine learning modern deep learning in 2018 right here at sigraph we announced RTX the world's first realtime interactive R Tracer R tracing platform we call it RTX it was such a big deal that we changed the name of GTX which everybody refer to our graphics cards as to RTX uh another shout out for for uh uh a great researcher his name is Steph Parker uh many of you know he's been coming to C for a long time uh he passed this year and uh he was a a he was one of the one of the core uh Pioneer researchers behind realtime R raate tracing and we miss them dearly and so anyways uh and you mentioned last year during your sigraph keynote that RTX R tracing extreme was one of the big important moments when computer Graphics met AI That's right but that had been happening for a while actually so what was so what was so important about RTX in 2018 well RTX in 2018 so you know we uh we accelerated uh Ray traversal and bounding box uh detection and and um uh and we made it possible to uh use a parallel processor to accelerate rate tracing um but even then we were rate tracing at about you know frame every call it you know 10 frames maybe every second let's say maybe five frames every second depending on on how how many how many Rays we're talking about tracing and we were doing it at 1080 resolution uh obviously video games uh need a lot more than that obviously real-time Graphics need more than that this crowd definitely knows what that means but for the folks who are watching online who don't work in this field I mean this is basically a way of really manipulating light in computer Graphics simulating how a light interacts with versus through right happening in real time that's right the rendering processes used to take a really long time when you were making something it used to take a Cay supercomputer to render just a few pixels and now we have our RTX to accelerate that rate tracing but it was interactive it was real time but it wasn't fast enough to be uh a video game and so we realized that that we needed a big boost probably something along the lines of 20x or so maybe 50x or so boost and so uh the team uh invented dlss which basically renders one pixel while it uses AI to infer a whole bunch of other pixels and so we basically taught an AI that is conditioned on what it saw and then say fills in fills in the dots for everything else and now we're able to render fully Ray Trace fully path Trace simulation ations at 4K resolution at 300 frames per second made possible by by Ai and so 2018 came along uh 2022 as we all know chat GPT came out but the and what's that again chat GPT you know that yes open AI chat GPT a revolutionary revolutionary new uh new capability Ai and fastest growing service in history um but the two things that I wanted to highlight since since jgp the industry researchers um many of them in the room has figured out how to use AI to learn everything not just words but to learn the meaning of images and videos and 3D chemicals protein physics thermal dynamics fluid dynamics particle physics it's figured out the meaning of these uh all these different modalities and since then not only have we learned it we can now generate it and so you could that's the reason why you can go from text to images text to 3D images to text 3D to text text to video so on so forth text to proteins text to chemicals and so now generative AI has been uh made possible and this is really the Revolutionary time that we're in just about every industry is going to be affected by this just based on based on some of the examples I've already given you whether it's scientific Computing trying to do a better job uh predicting the weather with a lot less energy to uh augmenting and collaborating with with us uh creators to generate images or you know generating virtual scenes for industrial digitalization and very importantly robotics self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative Ai and so here we are in this brand new way of doing things and so let me just very quickly Lauren if you look at where we started in the upper left in 1964 uh the way that software was programmed human Engineers programming software now we have machines that are learning how to program the software de writing software that no humans can solving problems that we we could barely imagine before and now because we have generative AI a new way of developing software you know you you you I don't know if you know do you know Andre karpathy he's a really really terrific researcher I met him when he was at Stanford and and uh he coined the original way of doing software software 1.0 machine learning to be software 2.0 and now really we're moving toward software 3.0 because these generative AIS in the future instead of using machine learning to learn a new AI for every researcher you'll probably start with pre-trained models Foundation models that are already pre-trained and the way that we develop software could very very much be like assembling teams with Experts of various AI capabilities some that are using uh tools some that are able to generate you know special things and then a general purpose AI that's really good at reasoning that's connecting this this network of AIS together solving problems like team solve problems and so software 3.0 is here I've gotten the sense from talking to you recently that you are optimistic that this these generative AI tools will become more controllable more accurate we all know that there are issues with hallucinations uh low quality outputs that people are using these tools and they're maybe not getting exactly the output that they're hoping for right meanwhile they're using a lot of energy which we're going to talk about why are you so optimistic about this what is what do you think is pointing Us in the direction of this generative AI actually becoming that much more useful and controllable well uh the big breakthrough of Chad GPT uh was reinforcement learning human feedback which was uh the way of using humans to produce the right answers or the best answers to align the AI on our core values or align our AI on the skills that we would like it to perform that's probably the just the extraordinary breakthrough that made it possible for them to open chat GPT for everyone everyone to use other breakthroughs have have uh arrived since then Guard railing which uh which causes the AI to focus its energy or Focus its response in a particular domain so that uh it doesn't wander off and pontificate about all kinds of stuff that you ask it about it would only focus on the things that it's been trained to do align to perform and um uh that it it has deep knowledge in the third the third breakthrough is called uh retrieval augmented generation which basically is vectorized or data that has been uh embedded so that we understand the meaning of that data and so it's a more authoritative data set it goes beyond just the trained data set and it actually pulls from other sources that's right it's not just pre-ra data source it's and something you know for example uh it might be uh all of the articles that you've ever written all of the papers that you've ever written and so now it becomes uh something an AI That's authoritative on your uh and it could be essentially a uh a chatbot of you uh so everything that I've ever written or ever said could be vectorized and then created into a semantic database and then before an AI responds it would uh figure it would look at look at your prompt and it would uh it would uh search uh the appropriate content from that Vector database and then augment it um in its gener generative process and you think that that is one of the most important factors these three combinations really made it possible for us to do that with text now the thing that's really cool is that we are now starting to figure out how to do that with visuals right and you know sigraph is really about a lot about images and and generation and so if you look at today's generative AI uh you could give it a a prompt and it goes into uh in this particular case this is a uh edify uh AI model that Nvidia created it's a 2d text to 2D Foundation model it's multimodal and um uh we used uh we partnered with GTI to use uh their library of data uh to train uh an AI model and so this is a a text to uh 2D image and you also created this slide personally right I well I had I personally had the slide created and so imagine I'm the prompt and then there's a team that that's kind of like a generative Ai and then magically uh this slide shows up and so so here here's a prompt uh and this could be a prompt for somebody who owns a brand it could be a brand of um for in this case Coca-Cola it could be a car it could be a luxury product it could be anything and so uh you you use the prompt and generate the image however as you know it's hard to control this prompt and it may hallucinate uh it may um uh create it in such a way that it's not exactly what you want and to fine-tune this using words is really really hard because as you know words is very low dimensional ity it's extremely compressed in its content but it's it's very imprecise and so the ability for us to now control that image uh is difficult to do and so we've created a way that allows us to uh control and align that with more conditioning and so the way you do that is we create another model and this model for example allows us to text to 3D on the bottom it's called and it's edify 3D one of our foundation models we've created this AI Foundry where Partners can come and work with us and we create the model for them with their data we invent the model and they bring their data and we uh create a model that they can take with them is it their data only uses their data so this only uses all of the data that's available on Shutterstock uh that they have have the rights to to use the train and so we now use prompt generator 3D we put that in Omniverse Omniverse uh as you know is a is a place where you could compose uh data and content from a lot of different modalities it could be 3D it could be AI it could be animation it could be materials and so we use Omniverse to compose all of these multimodality uh data and now you can control it you could you could change the pose you could change the placement you could change whatever you like and then you use that image out of Omniverse to condition The Prompt okay so you take what comes out of Omniverse you now augment it with the prompt it's a little bit like augment retrieval augment a mented generation this is now 3D augmented generation Getty uh the edified model is multimodal so it understand the image understands the prompt and it uses it in combination to create a new image so now this is a controlled image and so this way we can use uh generative AI as a as a collaborator as a you know as a partner to to work with us um and uh uh we can generate images exactly the way we like it how does this translate to the physical world how does it translate to something like robotics well we're going to talk about robotics but one of the things that I would love to show you and I had this made not by myself well I had it made myself okay this is an Incredible video and this is a uh this is a work that is done by wpp uh Shutterstock uh working with uh some of the brand uh world class world famous brands that you'll you'll know let's run the video Let's show the build me a table in an empty room surrounded by chairs in a busy restaurant build me a table with tacos and bowls of salsa in the Morning Light build me a car on an empty road surrounded by trees buy a modern house build me a house with hills in the distance and bales of hay in the Evening Sun build me a tree in an empty field build me hundred of them in all Direction with bushes and Vines hanging in between building a giant brain forest with exotic flowers and rays of sunlight isn't that incredible and so so let so this is so this is this is what happened we taught we taught an AI how to speak USD open USD and so the young the the the girl is speaking to Omniverse Omniverse generates the USD and use USD search to then find the catalog of uh 3D objects that it has it composes the scene using words and and then um generative AI uh uses that augmentation to generate uh to condition the generation process and and so therefore uh the work that you do could be much much better controlled you could even collaborate with people because you can collaborate in Omniverse and you can collaborate in 3D it's hard to collaborate uh in 2D and so we can collaborate in 3D augment the generation process I imagine a lot of people in this room who aren't just technical but they're also storytellers this is a very technical room storytellers see something like this there's like 90% phds in here and think I'm not even going to ask you to do a raising of your hand but I'm sure that would be fascinating so they see something like this I see something like this and I think okay that's pretty amazing you are speeding up rendering times you're creating images out of nothing there are probably just as many people thinking what does this mean for my job where do you draw the line between this is augmenting and helping people where do you see the line being drawn and this is replacing certain things that humans do well that's what tools do uh we invent tools here this you know this conference is about inventing technology that ultimately ends up being a tool and that Tool uh either accelerates our work um uh collaborates with us so that we could do uh better work or even bigger work uh do work that's uh impossible before and so I think what you're going to what you you'll likely see is that generative AI uh is now going to be more controllable than before we've been able to do that with using uh Rags retrieval augmented generation to control uh text generation better reducing hallucination now we're using Omniverse with generative AI to control generative uh images better and reduce hallucination both of those tools uh help us be more productive and do things that we otherwise can't do and so I think I think um for all of the artists in the world I what I would say is is uh jump on this tool give it a try um imagine the stories that you're going to be able to tell uh with these tools and um uh and with respect to jobs uh I would say that it is very likely all of our jobs are going to be changed in what way well my job is going to change um the way in the future uh I'm going to be prompting a whole bunch of AIS uh everybody will have an AI that is an assistant and so every single company every single company every single job within the company will have AIS that are assistant to them our software programmers as you so you know now have AIS that help them program uh all all of our software Engineers have AIS that help them debug software uh we have AIS that help our chip designers design chips uh without without AI uh Hopper wouldn't have been possible without AI Blackwell wouldn't be possible you know today we're this week we're sampling we're sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world they're under people's chairs right now I think if you just look if you get a GPU and you and I yeah you get a GPU you get a GPU yeah that's right supply chain we all we all we all wish yeah yeah and so so um I none none of the work that we do would be possible anymore without without generative Ai and uh that's increasingly the case with uh uh uh Our IT department helping our employees be more productive uh it's increasingly the case with our supply chain team optimizing Supply uh to be as efficient as possible um or our data center team using AI to manage the data center to save as much energy as possible you mentioned Omniverse before yeah uh that's not new but the idea that more generative AI would be within the Omniverse helping people create these simulations or digital twins yeah that's what we're announcing this week by the way Omniverse now Omniverse now uh understands uh text to USD um it could understand text to uh and has a semantic database so that it could do search of all the 3D objects um and uh that's how that that young lady was able to to say fill fill uh the scene with a whole bunch of trees uh describing how she would like the trees to be organized and somehow populates it with all these 3D trees then when that when that's done that 3D scene then goes into a generative AI uh uh model which turns turns it into a photorealistic model and if you want the the Ford truck to not be augmented but to use the the the actual brand um brand ground Truth uh then it would it would honor that and keep that uh keep that in the or in the final scene and so so I think if you if you if you do that uh so one of the things that that we talked about is how every single every single group in the company uh will have will have ai assistance and and um there's a lot of question lately about about um uh whether all this infrastructure that we're building is leading to productive work in companies I just gave you an example of how generative AI is impossible without without uh Nvidia nvidia's designs would be impossible without generative AI so we use it to transform the way we work but we also use it uh in many examples that I've just shown you in creating new products and new technology that either makes possible uh rate tracing in real time uh or Omniverse that we can now uh uh imagine and help us uh create much larger scenes um or uh our self-driving car work or our robotics work uh none of that none of that new capability would be possible without it and so one of the things that that we're announcing here uh this week is uh the concept of uh digital uh agents uh digital AIS uh that will augment every single job in the company and so uh one of the one of the the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service and every single group every single company has customer service every single industry has customer service uh and in the future uh it's going today it's it's humans uh doing customer service but in the future my guess is that it's going to be human still but AI in the loop and the benefit of that is that you'll be able to uh uh retain uh the the um uh the experiences of all the customer service agents that you have and capture that institutional knowledge that you can then run into analytics that you can then uh use to create uh better services for your customers uh the the just now I showed you a a Omniverse augmented generation for images this is a rag this is a uh retrieval augmented generative Ai and the thing that we're doing is is uh We've created this customer service basically uh microservice that sits in the cloud and it's going to be available I think today or tomorrow and you can come and try it and we connected to it a digital human front end basically an IO uh the io of an AI that has the ability to uh speak make eye contact with you um an animate in an empathetic way um and uh uh you could decide to connect your chat chat gbt or your AI I to the digital human or you can connect um uh your digital human to our uh retrieval augmented generation uh customer service AI uh so however you like to do it we're a platform company so irrespective of which piece you would like to use uh they're completely open source and you can come and use the pieces that you like uh if you would like the incredible digital human rendering technology that we've created for uh rendering beautiful faces uh which requires subsurface scattering with path tracing this breakthrough uh is really quite incredible and it makes it possible for us amazing Graphics researchers welcome to sigraph 2024 so it makes it possible to animate uh using an AI so uh you you chat with the AI it generates text that text then is translated uh to sound text to speech that speech the sound then animates the face and and then RTX path tracing um does the does the rendering of the digital human and so all of this is available for developers to use and you could you could decide which parts you would like to use how are you thinking about the ethics of something like this you're unleashing this to developers to Graphics artists but these are being Unleashed into the world y do you think a chatbot like that a a very human like visual chatbot should say that it's a chatbot what is it so human that people start mistaking it for humans they're emotionally vulnerable it's it's still it's still pretty it's still pretty robotic and I think that that's not a terrible thing you know we're going to stay we're going to be robotic for for some time I think it we've made we've made uh this digital human technology uh quite realistic but you and I know it's still a it's still a robot and so I I think um uh that's not a that's not a a horrible way um it is the case that there are many many different applications where the human engagement is much uh much more engaging uh having a human representation or near human representation than a text box uh maybe somebody needs companion or Healthcare needs to advise um somebody who is an outpatient uh who had just gone home uh you know helping elderlies um you know there's a whole bunch of applications uh a tutor which to educate a child um all these different applications are better off having somebody who is much more human and being able to connect with uh with the audience that's interesting yeah what I hear you talking a lot about today these are software developments right they're relying on your gpus But ultimately this is software this is NVIDIA going further up the stack meanwhile there are some companies some folks in the generative AI space who are in software and Cloud services but they're looking to go further down the stack right they might be developing their own chips or tpus that are competitive with what you are doing how crucial is this software strategy to Nvidia maintaining its lead and actually fulfilling some of these promises of growth that people are looking at for NVIDIA right now well um we've always been a software company um and even first and the reason for that is because accelerated Computing is not general purpose Computing general purpose Computing can take any c program or C Supply program Python and just run it and almost everybody's uh program can be compiled to run effectively unfortunately when you want to accelerate fluid dynamics you have to understand the the algorithms of fluid dynamics so that you could uh refactor it in such way that it could be accelerated and you have to design an accelerator you have to design the cou at GPU so that it understands the algorithms so that it could do a good job accelerating it and the benefit of course is that we can by doing so by redesigning the whole stack we can accelerate applications 20 40 50 times 100 times for example uh we just put um Nvidia gpus in in uh gcp uh running pandas uh which is the world's leading uh data science platform and we accelerated from 50 to 100x over general purpose Computing uh in the case of deep learning over the course of last 10 to 12 years or so uh We've accelerated deep learning by a million times which is the reason why it's now possible for us to create these large language models a million times speed up a million times reduction in cost and energy is what made it possible for us to make General generative AI possible but that's not that's that's by designing a new processor a new system tensor core gpus the mvlink switch fabric uh is completely groundbreaking for AI of course the systems itself the algorithms the distributed computing uh uh uh Library we call Megatron that everybody uses um tensor rtlm those are algorithms and if you don't understand the algorithms the the applications above it it's really hard to figure out how to design that whole stack what is the most important part of Nvidia software ecosystem for nvidia's future well every single one of it takes a new library we call it dsl's domain specific Library um in in uh in generative AI that DSL is called qnn uh for SQL processing uh data frames is called qdf and so if you go SQL pandas uh CDF is what makes it possible for us to accelerate that for Quantum emulation it's called K Quantum uh uh C fft we got a whole bunch of coups uh computational lithography which makes it makes it possible for us to uh help the industry Advance the next generation of processed technology called K litho um you know the the number of coups it goes on and on every time we introduce a domain specific Library it exposes accelerated Computing to a new market and so as you see it takes that collaboration the the the the the um uh the full stack of the library and the architecture and the go to market and developers and the ecosystems around it to open up a new field and so it's not just about building the accelerator you have to build a whole stack nvidia's dependent on a lot of things going right your your foray into the future your Innovation depends on a lot of things going right you have to continue pushing the laws of physics you do have competitors who are nipping at your heels at all times we've talked about this what keeps you up at night uh you're also somewhat relling on the geopolitical stability last night just so you know elevation drink some water that's what they told me but it was it was too late by the time I learned about it this morning I I woke up with a a terrible headache elevation that's what was last night okay so elevation uh but truly you have to keep pushing the laws of physics you have competitors who are nipping at your heels both on the software and Hardware side you are somewhere Aliant on the geopolitical stability of the South China Sea uh geopolitics uh so much going on right now you're reminding me it's it's it's super hard building a company it is you but you've had a lot of you're making me nervous I was fine before there's so many things that he wants to go back to showing you slides uh but truly you've and you've had you've had a lot of Tailwinds and I'm just you know how optimistic are you that these the things are going to keep trending in your direction things have never trended in our Direction uh you have to will the future into existence accelerated Computing you know the world wants general purpose computing and the reason for that is because it's easy you just you just have the software it just runs twice as fast every single year don't even think about it and you know every five years is 10 times faster every 10 years is 100 times faster what's not to love but of course you can shrink a transistor but you can't shrink an atom and eventually uh the CPU architecture uh ran its course and so we it's not sensible anymore uh as the technology doesn't give us those leaps that a general purpose instrument could be good at everything you know could be good at these incredible things from Deep learning to Quantum simulation to molecular Dynamics the fluid dynamics right so on the computer graphics and so we created this accelerated Computing architecture to do that um but that that that fights that fight that's headwind do you see what I'm saying because general purpose Computing is the easy way to do it we've been doing it for 60 years why not keep doing it and so so accelerated Computing was only possible because we we deliver such extreme extraordinary speedups at a time when energy is becoming more scarce um at a time when when um uh we no longer could just ride the CPU curve any longer dard scaling is has has really uh ended and um I and so we need another approach and and that's why that's why we're here but notice every single time we want to open up a new market like qdf in order to do data processing data processing is probably what a third of the world data a third of the world's Computing every company does data processing and most companies data is in data frames you know in tabular format and so in order to create an acceleration library for tabular formats was insanely hard because what's inside those tables could be floating Point numbers 64-bit integers it could be you know numbers and letters and all kinds of stuff and so we have to figure out a way to go compute all that and so so you see that almost every single time we want to grow into something you have to go and learn it that's the reason why we're working on robotics that's the reason why we're working on autonomous vehicles to understand the algorithms that's necessary to open up that market and to understand the Computing layer underneath it so that we can deliver extraordinary results and so as you could see each each time we open up a new market um healthare digital biology the work with the amazing work we're doing there with biion Nemo and uh uh parab bricks for Gene sequencing every single time we open up a new market it just requires us to reinvent everything of that Computing and so there's nothing easy about it generative AI takes up a lot of energy I'm just saying my job's super hard but your assistance you're your AI assistants are going to make it easier right what's that somebody's got to Pat my back hey little Applause you guys Cher on yeah go ahead uh let's talk about energy yeah generative AI incredibly energy intensive y uh I am going to read from my note cards here uh According to some research chat gbt a single query takes up nearly 10 times the electricity to process a single Google search uh data centers consume 1 to 2% of overall worldwide energy but some say that it could be as much as 3 to 4% some say as much as 6% by the end of the decade uh data center workloads tripled between 25 uh 2015 and 2019 that was only 2019 um AI generative AI is taking up a large portion of all of that is there going to be enough energy to fulfill the demand of what you want to build and do yeah um yes and um a couple of observations so first there there are two or three um or or three or four uh model makers that are pushing to Frontier a couple of years ago uh they're they're probably three times that many this year but it's still it's still single digit you know it's very high single digit but call a 10 that are pushing the frontiers of um of models and the size of the models are uh call it uh twice as large every year maybe maybe uh faster than that and in order to train a model that's twice as large you need you know more than twice as much data and so the computational load is growing um probably uh by you know call it a factor of four each year just for simple simple simple thinking now that's one of the reasons why Blackwell uh is is uh so highly anticipated because we accelerated the application uh so much using the same amount of energy and so this is an example of accelerating applications uh uh at constant energy constant cost you're making it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper now the important thing though is I've only highlighted 10 companies the world has tons of companies and their data centers everywhere and Nvidia is selling gpus to a whole lot of companies and a whole lot of different data centers and so question is what's happening at the core the first thing that's actually happening is the end of CPU scaling and the beginning of accelerated Computing data processing um uh just text completion speech recognition all of those kind of basic AI things that are that are used um recommender systems uh that are used in in data centers all over the world they are moving everyone is moving from CPUs to accelerated Computing because uh they want to save energy accelerated Computing helps you save so much energy 20 times 50 times in doing the same processing so the first thing that we have to do you know as a society is accelerate every application we can can if you're doing spark data processing ex run it with accelerated spark so that you could reduce the amount of energy necessary by 20 times if you're doing SQL processing do SQL um accelerated SQL so that you could reduce the power by 20 times and so uh uh if you're doing weather simulation accelerate it when you're doing uh whatever scientific simulation you're doing accelerated uh image processing accelerated a lot of those applications used to be uh running on CPUs and general purpose Computing all of that should be accelerated going forward that's the first thing that's happening now it is that reducing the amount of energy being used all over the world absolutely the density of our gpus and density of accelerated Computing is higher energy density is higher but the amount of energy used is dramatically lower so that's the first thing that's happening of course then generative AI generative AI is probably consuming let's pick a very large number probably you know 1% or so of the world's energy but remember even if the data centers uh consume 4% of the world the goal of generative AI is not training the goal of generative AI is inference and the inference ideally we create new models for predicting weather uh predicting new materials allow us to uh um uh optimize uh our supply chain reduce the amount of energy consumed and wasted gasoline uh as we deliver products and so the goal is actually to reduce the energy consumed of the 96% and so uh very importantly you have to think about gener about AI from a longitudinal perspective not just going to school but what happens after going to school you and I both went to Stanford Stanford's not inexpensive um I think you studied something slightly different though yeah yeah sure it's a big school it's worked out well for it's worked out well for both of us and so and so so the goal of course is is is going to school is important uh but of course the important thing is is really after school and all of the contributions that we're made we're able to make the society and so generative AI is going to increase productivity it's going to Ena enable us to discover new science make things more energy efficient um don't let me don't let me finish without without showing you uh the next and so so that the lights just came on because why we were talking about energy and all of a sudden it's like the Earth was like okay Tamp down the energy usage folks I thought I thought they were G am I getting Chang we still have a few minutes so I mean I hope so I mean I'm not I'm not going to get off the stage until Mark comes on here and kicks me off how about that he's not going to do that he's a great guy so anyways uh think think think about generative AI um longitudinally and all the impact of of generative AI the second thing the next thing I'll say about generative AI is remember in the the traditional way doing Computing is called retrieval based Computing everything is pre-recorded all the stories are written pre-recorded all the images are pre-recorded all the videos are pre-recorded and so and so everything is stored off in a data center somewhere pre-recorded generative AI reduces the amount of energy necessary to go run to a data center over the network re retrieve something and bring it over the network don't forget the data center is not the only place that consumes energy the world's Data Center only rep that is only 40% of the total Computing done 60% of the energy is consumed on the internet moving the electrons around moving the bits and bites around and so generative AI is going to reduce the amount of energy on the internet because instead of having to go retrieve the information we can generate it right there on the spot because we understand the context we probably have some uh content already on the device and we can generate the response so that you don't have to go retrieve it uh somewhere else well part of that is also moving atoms around right one last thing I got to tell you laen one last thing I remember AI doesn't care where it goes to school today's data centers are are built near the power grid where Society is of course because that's where we need it in the future you're going to see data centers being built in different parts of the world where there's excess energy it's just that it costs a lot of money to bring that energy to society maybe it's in a desert maybe it's uh in places that has a lot of sustainable energy but it's not a lot of water well uh there's plenty of water as well it just happens to be undrinkable water and so uh we can use we can use water that are uh we we can we can put data centers where there's less population and um more energy okay just don't don't forget that there's there's plenty there's a lot of energy coming from the Sun there's a lot of energy in the world and what we need to do is move data centers out closer to where there's excess energy and not put everything near population well part AI doesn't care where it's trained part I'd never heard that phrase before AI doesn't care where it goes to school and that's interesting yeah it's true I'm going to think on that yeah uh part of part of calculating the carbon emissions though is also considering the supply chain it's also considering it's going all down the line uh and it requires transparency don't don't move don't move the energy to the data center use the energy where the data center is and then when you're done uh you have a highly compressed model that is essentially the compression of all the energy that was used and we can take that model and bring it back hey can we talk about the next wave so the first wave of course the first wave is accelerated Computing I think I know that she's the interviewer and we're on we're we're we're doing this on her terms but I'm the CEO so so and and and so so no Lauren we we need to come and tell tell this this group about the work that we're doing that that that uh is is really really Court to I I have so many good questions for you I know I know I want to ask you about open source which I think you're going to be talking to Mark about I I want to ask you about I have it import by the way open source is really important it's incredible yeah if not if if not for open source if not for open source uh how would all of these industries and all these companies be able to engage Ai and so look at look at all the companies and all the different Industries they're all using llama llama 2 today today llama 3.1 just came out uh people are so excited about it uh We've we've made it possible to democratize Ai and engage every single industry in AI but the thing that I want to say is this the first wave is accelerated Computing reduces energy consumed allows us to deliver continued computational demand without all of the Power continued to grow with it so number one accelerate everything it made it possible for us to have generative AI the generative AI the first wave of it of of course is all the pioneers and we you know we know many of the Pioneers open AI anthropic uh Google uh Microsoft a whole bunch of amazing companies doing this uh uh X is doing this x. is doing this amazing companies doing this the next the next wave of AI we we didn't talk about which is uh Enterprise of course one of its applications is customer service and we hope that we can uh give every single organization the ability to create their own AIS and so everybody would be augmented and and have a collaborative AI that could um uh Empower them help them do better work the next wave of AI after that is called physical Ai and this is this is really really quite extraordinary this is where we're going to need three computers one computer to uh create the AI another computer toes simulate the AI both using synthetic gen for synthetic data generation as well as a place where the AI robot the humano robot or the the manipulation robot could go learn how to uh refine its Ai and then of course the third AI is the computer that actually runs the AI so it's a threea three computer problem you know it's a three body problem and so it's incredibly comp it's incredibly complicated and we created three computers to do that and we made a video uh for you for you to enjoy uh understanding this the thing that that we've done here is this uh in every each one of these computers depending on whether you want to use the software stack the algorithms on top or just the Computing infrastructure just a processor for the robot or the functional safety operating system that runs on top of it or the AI and computer vision models that run on top of that or uh just the computer itself any piece is any layer of that stack is open uh for robotics uh developers we created a quick video let's take a look at that is that okay that sounds great the era of physical AI is here physical AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world will embody robots many will be humanoid robots developing these Advanced robots is complex requiring vast amounts of data and workload orchestration across diverse Computing infrastructures Nvidia is working to simplify and accelerate developer workflows with three Computing platforms Nvidia AI Omniverse and Jetson Thor plus generative AI enabled developer tools to accelerate project Groot a general humanoid robot Foundation model Nvidia researchers capture human demonstrations seeing the robot's hands in spatial overlay over the physical world they then use robokos a generative simulation framework integrated into Nvidia Isaac lab to produce a massive number of environments and layouts they increase their data size using mimic gen M which helps them generate large scale synthetic motion data sets based on the small number of original captures they train the Groot model on Nvidia dgx cloud with the combined real and synthetic data sets next they perform software in the loop testing in Isaac Sim and the cloud and Hardware in the loop validation on Jetson Thor before deploying the improved model to the real robots Nvidia osmo robotics Cloud compute orchestration service manages job assignment and scaling across distributed resources throughout the workflow together these Computing platforms are empowering developers worldwide to bring us into the age of physical AI powered humanoid robot you know you know what's amazing Lauren at this conference sigraph is where all of this technology comes together isn't that right everybody researchers of sigraph isn't that right so whether it's computer Graphics or simulation artificial intelligence robotics all of it comes right comes together right here at sigra and that's the reason why I think you should come to sigra from now on me yes I'm happy to I'm thrilled to you I I I took I took uh uh I want 100% of the world's Tech press should come to Cigar we can get behind that just drink a lot of water um uh I went and saw some of the art exhibits last night upstairs in the exhibition effort fantastic just really really cool loved the literal spam Bots whoever created that one go check it out um I was actually listening to the sigraph spotlight podcast before this if folks haven't listened I I really recommend it uh the special projects chair was interviewing a couple of Graphics Legends including David yam yeah and one of the things that David M talked about was archives and this is kind of an existential question for this crowd right but people are creating this really amazing digital media all these these computer Graphics you are accelerating it with your technology it changes so fast now how do you ensure that everything folks are building lives into the future file formats archives accessing all of this work in the future the robots will live on y I have no concern they're going to take over y right Y what about what about the art that people are creating this is this is the existential question but all this well one of the one of the one of the uh that's an excellent question and one of the one of the um the formats that we deeply believe in is open USD open USD is the first format that brings together multimodality from almost almost every single tool and allows it uh to interact to be composed together uh to uh go in and out of these Virtual Worlds and so you could bring in just about any format ideally over time into it uh at this conference we announced that URF the universal robotics data format is now compatible with or can be ingested into into um uh open USD and so one one format after another format uh we're going to bring uh everything into this one common one common language using standards is one of the best ways uh to uh allow content and data to uh be shared be allow everybody to collaborate on it and to lift forever for example HTML without HTML uh it would have been hard for all of these different content from around the world to be accessible to everybody and so in a lot of ways open USD is the HTML of Virtual Worlds and um uh we we've we've been a early promoter of it um uh there's uh amazing companies that have joined and many other companies joining and um my expectation is every single design tool in the world will be able to connect to open USD and once you connect to that virtual world uh you can collaborate with uh anybody with any other Tool uh anywhere and so just like we with HTML you said this content can live forever are you going to build a gensen AI that lives forever absolutely there's a gensen AI in fact just about everything that I've ever said everything that I've ever written and ever done uh will likely be ingested into one of these uh uh generative AI models and I'm I'm I'm hoping that that happens and then uh in the future you'll be able to prompt it and and hopefully something smart gets said so jent and the might to be uh running your earnings calls in the future I hope so that's that's the first thing that has to go that's the first thing it has to go to a bot Jensen thank you so much I think we're probably going to get kicked off stage soon but you'll be back shortly with Mark Zuckerberg and welcome to your first cig ladies and gentlemen Lauren good thank you thank you it's really great shatting again thank you everybody we'll be right back Video games have spectacular graphics, capable of transporting you to incredibly detailed cities, heart-racing battlegrounds, magical worlds, and breathtaking environments. While this may look like an old western train station and locomotive from Red Dead Redemption 2, it’s actually composed of 2.1 million vertices assembled into 3.5 million triangles with 976 colors and textures assigned to the various surfaces, all with a virtual sun illuminating the scene below.But perhaps the most impressive fact is that these vertices, textures, and lights are entirely composed of ones and zeroes that’s continuously being processed inside your computer’s graphics card or a video game console. So then, how does your computer take billions of ones and zeroes and turn it into realistic 3D graphics? Well, let’s jump right in.The video game graphics rendering pipeline has three key steps: Vertex Shading, Rasterization, and Fragment Shading. While additional steps are used in many modern video games, these three core steps have been used for decades in thousands of video games for both computers and consoles and are still the backbone of the video game graphics algorithm for pretty much every game you play.Let’s begin with the first step called vertex shading. The basic idea in this step is to take all the objects’ geometries and meshes in a 3D space and use the field of view of the camera to calculate where each object falls in a 2D window called the view screen, which is the 2D image that’s sent to the display. In this train station scene, there are 1,100 different models and the camera’s field of view sections off what the player sees, reducing the number of objects that need to be rendered to 600. Let’s focus on the locomotive as an example.Although this engine has rounded surfaces and some rather complex shapes, it’s actually assembled from 762 thousand flat triangles using 382 thousand vertices and 9 different materials or colors applied to the surfaces of the triangles. Conceptually, the entire train is moved as one piece onto the viewscreen, but actually, each of the train’s hundreds of thousands of vertices are moved one at a time. So, let’s focus on a single vertex. The process of moving a vertex, and by extension, the triangles and the train, from a 3D world onto a 2D view screen is done using 3 transformations. First moving a vertex from model space to world space, then from world space to camera space, and finally from the perspective field of view onto the view screen. To perform this transformation we use the X,Y, and Z coordinates of that vertex in modeling space, then the position, scale, and rotation of the model in world space, and finally the coordinates and rotation of the camera and its field of view. We plug all these numbers into different transformation matrices and multiply them together resulting in the X and Y values of the vertex on the view screen as well as a Z value or depth, which we’ll use later to determine object blocking. After three vertices of the train are transformed using similar matrix math, we get a single triangle moved onto the view screen. Then the rest of the 382 thousand vertices of the train and the 2.1 million vertices of all the 600 objects in the camera’s field of view undergo a similar set of transformations, thereby moving all 3.5 million triangles onto a 2D viewscreen. This is an incredible amount of matrix math, but GPUs in graphics cards and video game consoles are designed to be triangle mesh rendering monsters and thus have evolved over decades to handle millions of triangles every few milliseconds. For example, this GPU has 10,000ish cores designed to efficiently execute up to 35 trillion operations of 32-bit multiplication and addition every second, and, by distributing the vertex co-ordinates and transformation data among each of the cores, the GPU can easily render the scene resulting in 120 or more frames a second. Now that we have all the vertices moved onto a 2D plane, the next step is to use the 3 vertices of a single triangle and figure out which specific pixels on your display are covered by that triangle. This process is called rasterization.A 4K monitor or TV has a resolution of thirty-eight forty by twenty-one sixty, yielding around 8.3 million pixels. Using the X and Y coordinates of the vertices of a given triangle on the view screen, your GPU calculates where it falls within this massive grid and which of the pixels are covered by that particular triangle. Next, those pixels are shaded using the texture or color assigned to that triangle. Thus, with rasterization, we turn triangles into fragments which are groups of pixels that come from the same triangle and share the same texture or color. Then we move on to the next triangle and shade in the pixels that are covered by it and continue to do this for each of the 3.5 million triangles that were previously moved onto the viewscreen. By applying the Red Blue and Green color values of each triangle to the appropriate pixels, a 4K image is formed in the frame buffer and sent to the display. You’re probably wondering how we account for triangles that overlap or block other triangles. For example, the train is blocking the view of much of the train station. Additionally, the train has hundreds of thousands of triangles on its backside that are sent through the rendering pipeline, but obviously don’t appear in the final image. Determining which triangles are in front is called the visibility problem and is solved by using a Z-buffer or Depth Buffer. A Z-Buffer adds an extra value to each of the 8.3 million pixels corresponding to the distance or depth that each pixel is from the camera.In the previous step, when we did the vertex transformations, we ended up with X and Y coordinates, but then also got a Z value that corresponds to the distance from the transformed vertex to the camera. When a triangle is rasterized, it covers a set of pixels and the Z value or depth of the triangle is compared with the values stored in the Z-Buffer. If the triangle’s depth values are lower than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is closer to the camera, then we paint in those pixels using the triangle’s color and re-place the Z-buffer’s values using that triangle’s Z-values. However, let’s say a second triangle comes along with Z values that are higher than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is further away. We just throw it out and keep the pixels from the triangle that was previously painted with lower Z-values. Using this method, only the closest triangles to the camera with the lowest Z-values will be displayed on the screen. By the way, here’s the image of the Z or Depth buffer, wherein black is close and white is far. Note that because these triangles are in 3D space, the vertices often have 3 different Z values, and thus each individual pixel of the triangle needs its Z value computed using the vertex coordinates. This allows intersecting triangles to properly render out their intersections pixel by pixel. One issue with rasterization and these pixels is that if the triangle cuts at an angle and passes through the center of the pixel, then the entire pixel is painted with that triangle’s color resulting in jagged and pixelated edges.To reduce the appearance of these jagged edges, graphics processors implement a technique called Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing. With SSAA, 16 sampling points are distributed across a single pixel, and when a triangle cuts through a pixel, depending on how many of the 16 sampling points the triangle covers, a corresponding fractional shade of that color is applied to the pixel, resulting in faded edges in the image and significantly less noticeable pixelization.One thing to remember is that when you’re playing a video game, your character’s camera view as well as the objects in the scene are continuously moving around. As a result, the process and calculations within vertex shading, rasterization, and fragment shading are recalculated for every single frame once every 8.3 milliseconds for a game running at 120 frames a second.Let’s move onto the next step which is Fragment Shading. Now that we have a set of pixels corresponding to each triangle, it’s not enough to simply paint by number to color the pixels. Rather, to make the scene realistic, we have to account for the direction and strength of the light or illumination, the position of the camera, reflections, and shadows cast by other objects. Fragment shading is therefore used to shade in each pixel with accurate illumination to make the scene realistic. As a reminder, fragments are groups of pixels formed from a single rasterized triangle. Let’s see the fragment shader in action. This train engine is mostly made of black metal, and if we apply the same color to each of its pixel fragments, we get a horribly inaccurate train. But once we apply proper shading, such as making the bottom darker and the top lighter, and by adding in specular highlights or shininess where the light bounces off the surface, we get a realistic black metal train. Additionally, as the sun moves in the sky, the shading on the train reflects the passage of time throughout the day, and, if it’s night, the materials and colors of all the objects are darker and illuminated from the light of the fire. Even video games such as Super Mario 64 which is almost 30 years old have some simple shading where the colors of surfaces are changed by the lighting and shadows in the scene. So, let’s see how fragment shading works. The basic idea is that if a surface is pointing directly at a light source such as the sun, it’s shaded brighter whereas if a surface is facing perpendicular to, or away from the light, it’s shaded darker.In order to calculate a triangle’s shading, there are two key details we need to know. First, the direction of the light and second, the direction the triangle’s surface is facing. Let’s continue to use the locomotive as an example and paint it bright red instead of black. As you already know, this train is made of 762 thou-sand flat triangles, many of which face in different directions. The direction that an individual triangle is facing is called its surface normal, which is simply the direction perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, kind of like a flagpole sticking out of the ground. To calculate a triangle’s shading, we take the cosine of the angle or theta between the two directions. The cosine theta value is 1 when the surface is facing the light and when the surface is perpendicular to the light it’s 0. Next, we multiply cosine theta by the intensity of the light and then by the color of the material to get the properly shaded color of that triangle. This process adjusts the triangles’ RGB values and as a result, we get a range of lightness to darkness of a surface depending on how its individual triangles are facing the light. However, if the surface is perpendicular or facing away, we don’t want a cosine theta value of 0 or a negative number because this would result in a pitch-black surface. Therefore, we set the minimum to 0 and add in an ambient light intensity times the surface color, and adjust this ambient light so that it’s higher in daytime scenes, and closer to 0 at night. Finally, when there are multiple light sources in a scene, we perform this calculation multiple times with different light directions, and intensities and then add the individual contributions together. Having more than a few light sources is computationally intense for your GPU, and thus scenes limit the number of individual light sources and sometimes limit the range of influence for the lights so that triangles will ignore distant lights. The vector and matrix math used in rendering video game graphics is rather complicated, but luckily there’s a free and easy way to learn it and that’s with Brilliant.org. Brilliant is a multidisciplinary online interactive education platform and is the best way to learn math, computer science, and many other fields of science and engineering. Thus far we’ve been simplifying the math behind video game graphics considerably. For example, vectors are used to find the value of cosine theta between the direction of the light and the surface normal, and the GPU uses the dot product divided by the norm of the two vectors to calculate it. Additionally, we skipped a lot of detail when it came to 3D shapes and transformations from one coordinate system to another using matrices. Rather fittingly, Brilliant.org has entire courses on vector calculus, trigonometry, and 3D geometry, as well as courses on linear algebra and matrix math. All of which have direct applications to this video and are needed for you to fully understand graphics algorithms.Alternatively, if you’re all set with math, we recommend their course on Thinking in Code which will help you build a solid foundation on computational problem solving.Brilliant is offering a free 30-day trial with full access to their thousands of lessons.

The link is in the description below.Let’s get back to exploring fragment shading. One key problem with it is that the triangles within an object each have only a single normal, and thus each triangle will share the same color throughout the triangle’s surface. This is called flat shading and is rather unrealistic when viewed on curved surfaces such as the body of this steam engine.So, in order to produce smooth shading, instead of using surface normals, we use one normal for each vertex calculated using the average of the normals of the adjacent triangles. Next, we use a method called barycentric coordinates to produce a smooth gradient of normals across the surface of a triangle. Visually it’s like mixing 3 different colors across a triangle, but instead we’re using the three vertex normal directions. For a given fragment we take the center of each pixel and use the vertex normals and coordinates of the pre-rasterized triangle to calculate the barycentric normal of that particular pixel. Just like mixing the three colors across a triangle this pixel’s normal will be a proportional mix of the three vertex normals of the triangle. As a result, when a set of triangles is used to form a curved surface, each pixel will be part of a gradient of normals resulting in a gradient of angles facing the light with pixel-by-pixel coloring and smooth shad-ing across the surface. We want to say that this has been one of the most enjoyable videos to make simply because we love playing video games and seeing the algorithm that makes these incredible graphics has been a joy. We spent over 540 hours researching, writing, modelling this scene from RDR2, and animating.

Thus far we’ve covered the core steps for the graphics rendering pipeline, however, there are many more steps and advanced topics. For example, you might be wondering where ray tracing and DLSS or deep learning super sampling fits into this pipeline. Ray tracing is predominately used to create highly detailed scenes with accurate lighting and reflections typically found in TV and movies and a single frame can take dozens of minutes or more to render. For video games, the primary visibility and shading of the objects are calculated using the graphics rendering pipeline we discussed, but in certain video games ray tracing is used to calculate shadows, reflections, and improved lighting. On the other hand, DLSS is an algorithm for taking a low resolution frame and upscaling it to a 4K frame using a convolution neural network. Therefore DLSS is executed after ray tracing and the graphics pipeline generates a low-resolution frame. One interesting note is that the latest generation of GPUs has 3 entirely separate architectures of computational resources or cores. CUDA or Shading cores execute the graphics rendering pipeline. Ray tracing cores are self-explanatory. And then DLSS is run on the Tensor cores. Therefore, when you’re playing a high-end video game with Ray Tracing and DLSS, your GPU utilizes all of its computational resources at the same time, allowing you to play 4K games and render frames in less than 10 milliseconds each. Whereas if you were to solely rely on the CUDA or shading cores, then a single frame would take around 50 milliseconds. With that in mind, Ray Tracing and DLSS are entirely different topics with their own equally complicated algorithms, and therefore we’re planning separate videos that will explore each of these topics in detail. Furthermore, when it comes to video game graphics, there are advanced topics such as Shadows, Reflections, UVs, Normal Maps and more. Therefore, we’re considering making an additional video on these advanced topics. If you’re interested in such a video let us know in the comments.

Thanks for watching to the end! ladies and gentlemen I have a very special guest but could I ask everybody to sit down we're about to get started my next my next guest I am so impressed by this person three reasons first reason is there are only a handful of entrepreneurs Founders that started a company that literally touched the lives of billions of people around the world as part of the social fabric invented services and a state-of-the-art Computing company two very few entrepreneurs Founders founded the company and led it to over a trillion dollars of value and three a College Dropout all three things simultaneously ladies and Gentlemen please help me welcome Mark Zuckerberg welcome Mark welcome to your first sigraph right can you believe this one of the pioneers of computing a driver of modern Computing and I had to invite him to sigraph so anyways marks it down it's great to have you here welcome thanks for flying down yeah know this will be fun I he been going for like five hours already or something well yeah sure this is sigraph you know this 90% phds And so so the thing that's really great about sigraph uh as you know this is this is the show of computer Graphics image processing artificial intelligence and Robotics combined and some of the some of the companies that over the years have demonstrated and revealed amazing things here from Disney Pixar Adobe epic games and of course you know Nvidia we've done a lot of work here this year uh we introduced 20 papers at the intersection of artificial intelligence and simulation so we're using artificial intelligence to do um help simulation uh be way larger scale way faster for example uh differentiable physics uh we're using simulation to create uh simulation environments for synthetic data generation for artificial intelligence and so these two areas is are really coming together um really proud of the work that we've done here at meta uh you guys have done amazing AI work I mean one of the things that that that I find amusing is is uh uh when the Press writes about how metas jumped into AI this last last couple of years um as if uh you know the the work that that fair has done uh remember we all use pytorch that comes out of meta uh the uh the work that you do in computer vision the work in uh language models real-time translation uh groundbreaking work I guess my first question for you is you know how do you see how do you see the uh uh the advances of generative AI ad meta today and how do you apply it to either enhance your operations or introduce new capabilities that you're offering yeah so oh a lot to unpack there first of all really happy to be here um you know meta has done a lot of work and has has been at sigra for you know eight years so I mean it's a you know we're noobs compared to to you guys but um you I think it was back in in 2018 you're dressed right but this is my hood I just want it's I mean well thank you for welcoming me to your hood um I think it was back in 2018 we we we showed the some of the early hand tracking work on um for our VR and mixed reality headsets um and I think we've talked a bunch about the progress that we're making on codec avatars the photorealistic um avatars that we want to be able to drive from consumer headsets which we're getting closer and closer to so pretty excited about that and also a lot of the display systems work that we've done so um some of the future prototypes and research for getting the mixed reality headsets to be able to be really thin with like with just um pretty Advanced Optical stacks and and display uh systems the the integrated system I that's that's been stuff that we've typically uh shown here first so um excited to be here uh you know this year not just talking about the metaverse stuff but but also um all the AI pieces which as you said I me we started Fair uh the the AI Research Center um at you know back then it was Facebook now meta uh before we started reality Labs I we've been at this for for a while um the you know all the stuff around gen it's it's an interesting Revolution and and and I think that it's going to it's going to end up making I think all of the different products that we do you know different and and in in interesting ways I mean I I kind of go through you can look at the big product lines that we have already so things like the you know feed and recommendation systems and Instagram and Facebook and we've kind of been on this journey where that's gone from just being about connecting with your friends and the ranking was always important because you even when you were just um you know following friends you know if someone did something really important like your cousin had a baby or something it's like you want that at the top you'd be pretty angry at us if we that was buried somewhere down in your feed um so the ranking was was important but now over the last few years it's gotten to a point where more of that stuff is um is just different public content that's out there the recommendation systems are super important because now instead of just a few hundred or thousand potential candidate posts from friends um there's millions of of of pieces of content and that turns into like a really interesting recommendation problem and with generative AI um I think we're going to quickly move into this Zone where not only is is the majority of the content that you see today on Instagram you know just recommended to you from kind of stuff that's out there in the world that matches your interests whether not you follow the people I think in the future a lot of the stuff is going to be created with these tools too some of that is going to be creators using the tools to create new content some of it I think eventually is going to be content that's either created on the Fly for you um or or or kind of pulled together and synthesize through different things that are out there so that that's just one example of how kind of the core part of what we're doing is just going to evolve and it's been evolving for for 20 years already but I think few people realize that that uh one of the largest Computing systems the world has ever conceived of a recommenders system yeah I mean it's this whole yeah it's this whole different path right it's it's not quite the kind of Genai hotness that people talk about but I think it's it's like as I mean it's all the Transformer architectures and it's a similar thing of just building up more more General models embeding embedding unstructured data into features and yeah I mean one of the big things that just drives quality improvements is you know it used to be that you'd have a different model for each type of content right so a recent example is you know we had you know one model for ranking and recommending reals and another model for ranking and recommending more long form videos and then you know take some product work to basically make it so that the system can display you know anything in line but you know the more you kind of just create more General recommendation models that can span everything it just gets better and better so I mean part of it I think is just like economics and liquidity of content and the broader of a pool that you can pull from you're you're just not having these weird inefficiencies of pulling from different pools but yeah mean as the models get bigger and more General that gets better and better so I I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being you know like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together that actually have different objectives over different time frames right because some of it is just showing you you know what's the interesting content that you're going to be that that you want to see today but some of it is helping you build out your network over the long term right people you may know accounts you might want to follow and these these multimodal models tend to be yeah tend to be much better at recognizing patterns weak signals and such and so one of the things that people people always you know it's so interesting that AI has been so deep in your company you've been building GPU infrastructure running these large recommender systems for a long time now you're now you're a little slow on it actually getting to gpus yeah I was trying to be nice I know well you know too nice I was trying to be nice you know my gu when I was backstage before I came on here you were talking about like owning your mistakes or something right so you don't have to volunteer it out of the blue I I think this one has been well tried it's like I got breaked over the but as soon as you got into it as soon as you got into it you got into it strong let's just put it there you go there you go now now now the thing that's really cool about about generative AI is is these days when I use WhatsApp I feel like I'm collaborating with what'sapp I love imagine I'm sitting you're typing and it's generating the images as I'm going I go back and I change my words it's generating other images yeah you know and and so the one that that o old Chinese guy uh enjoying a glass of whiskey at sundown with three dogs golden retriever golden doodle and a bernes mountain dog and it generates you know a pretty good looking pict yeah yeah we're we're getting there every month getting better and then now you could actually load my picture in there actually be me yeah that's as of last week yeah yeah super excited about that now imagine me I know I'm spending a lot of time with my daughters imagining them as mermaids and things over the last um over the last week it's been it's been a lot of fun but yeah I mean that's that's the other half of it I mean the a lot of the Gen stuff is going to on the one hand it's I think going to just be this big upgrade for all of the workflows and products that we've had for a long time but on the other hand there's going to be all these completely new things things that can now get created So Meta AI um you know the idea of having you know just an an AI assistant that can help you with different tasks and um in in our world is going to be you know very creatively oriented like you're saying but um but I mean they're very general so I you don't need to just constrain it to that it'll be able to answer any question um over time I think you know when we move from like the Llama 3 class of models to llama 4 and Beyond it's um it's going to I think feel less like a chat box where it's like you you give it a a a prompt and it just responds then you give it a prompt and it responds and it's just like back and forth I think it's going to pretty quickly evolve to you give it an intent and it actually can go away on multiple time frames and I mean it probably should acknowledge that you gave it an intent up front but I mean you know some of the stuff I think will end up you know it'll spin up you know compute jobs that take you know weeks or months or something then just come back to you when like something happens in the world and I think that that's going to be really powerful so I mean today's AI as you as you know is kind of turnbas you say something it says something back to you um but obviously when we think when we're given a mission or we're giving a problem you know we we'll contemplate multiple options or maybe we come up with a you know a tree of options a decision tree and we walk down to the decision tree simulating in our mind you know what are the different outcomes of each decision that we could potentially make and so we we're doing planning and so in the the future AIS will will kind of do the same one of the things that that I was super excited about when you talked about your vision of Creator AI I just think that's that's a home run idea frankly tell everybody about the Creator Ai and AI Studio that's going to enable you to do that yeah so so we actually I mean this is something that we're we're you know we've talked about it a bit but we're rolling it out a lot wider today um you know a lot of our vision is that I don't think that there's just going to be like one AI model right I mean this is something that some of the other companies in the industry they're like you know it's like they're building like one Central agent and and yeah we we'll have the metai assistant that you can use but a lot of our vision is that we want to empower all the people who use our products to basically create agents for themselves whether that's you know all the many many millions of creators that are on the platform or you know hundreds of millions of small businesses um we eventually want to just be able to pull in all your content and very quickly stand up a business agent and um be able to interact with your customers and you know do sales and customer support and all that so the one that we're that we're just starting to roll out more now is um we call it AI studio and it basically is um a set of tools that eventually is going to make it so that every Creator can build sort of an AI version of themselves um as as sort of an an agent or an assistant that that their Community can interact with there's kind of a fundamental issue here where there's there's just not enough hours in the day right it's like if you're if you're a Creator you want to engage more with your community um but you you you're constrained on time and similarly your community wants to engage with you uh but it's tough I mean there's there's just there's a limited time to do that so the next best thing is is allowing people to basically create these artifacts right it's um it's sort of it's an agent but it's you train it to kind of on on your material um to represent you in the way that you want I think it it's it's a very kind of creative Endeavor almost like a like a piece of of art or content that you're putting out there and know it's it's going to be very clear that it's not engaging with the Creator themselves but I think it'll be another interesting way just like how creators put out content on on these um social systems to be able to have agents that do that similarly I think that there's going to be a thing where people basically create their own agents for all different kinds of uses some will be sort of customized utility things that they're trying to get done that they want to kind of fine-tune and and train an agent for some of will be entertainment and some of the things that people create are just funny you know and just kind of silly in different ways or or kind of have a funny attitude about things that um you know we probably couldn't we probably wouldn't build into meta AI as an assistant but but I think people um people are are kind of pretty interested to see um and interact with and then one of the interesting use cases that we're seeing is people kind of using these agents for support um this was one thing that that was a little bit surp surprising to me is one of the top use cases for meta AI already is people basically using it to roleplay difficult social situations that they're going to be in so whether it's a professional situation it's like all right I want to ask my manager like how do I get a promotion or raise or I'm having this fight with my friend or I'm having this difficult situation with my girlfriend like how like how can this conversation go and basically having a like a completely judgment free zone where you can basically roleplay that and see how how how the conversation will go and and get feedback on it um but a lot of people they don't just want to interact with the same kind of you know agent whether it's met AI or chat GPT or whatever it is that everyone else is using they want to kind of create their own thing so that's that's roughly where we're going with AI Studio but it's all part of this bigger I I guess view that we have that there shouldn't just be kind of one big AI that people interact with we we we just think that the world will be better and more if there's a diversity of these different things I just think it's so cool that if you're an artist and you have a style you could take your style all of your body of work you could fine-tune yeah one of your models yeah and now this becomes an AI model that you can come and you could prompt it you could ask me to uh you know create something along the lines of the art style that I have and you might even give me a piece of art as a make a drawing a sketch as an inspiration and I can generate something for you and it's and you come to my come to my uh uh you know come to my bot for that come to my AI for that it could be it could be a uh every single uh every single restaurant every single website will probably in the future have these AIS yeah I mean I I kind of think that in the future just like every business has you know an email address and a website and a social media account or several I think in the future every business is going to have an AI agent that interfaces with their customers and some of these things I think have been pretty hard to do historically like um if you think about any company it's like you probably have customer support is just a separate organization from sales and that's not really how you'd want it to work as CEO it's just that okay they're kind of different skills you're building up these I'm your customer support just a what's up I'm your yeah well apparently I am yeah I mean whenever Mark needs something as CEO I can't tell whether it's chatbot or it's Mark but he it's just my chatbot just asking you um no well I guess that's kind of yeah when you're CEO you have to do all the stuff but but I mean then when you build the abstraction into your organization a lot of times like the you know in general the organizations are separate because they're kind of optimized for different things but I think like the platonic ideal of this would be that it's kind of one thing right as a you know as a customer you don't really care you know you don't want to like have a different route when you're trying to buy something versus if you're having an issue with something that you bought you just want to have a place that you can go and get your questions answered and be able to um engage with the business in different ways and I think that that applies for creators too I think that the the kind of personal consumer side of this is all that engagement with your customers especially if their complaints is going to make your company better yeah totally right the fact that it's all engaging with this AI is going to capture the the uh the institutional knowledge and how to and all of that can go into analytics which improves the AI and so on so forth yeah yeah so the business version of this is um that I think has a little more integration and we're still in in a pretty early Alpha that but the AI Studio making it so people can kind of create their ugc agents and and different things and getting started on this flywheel of having creators create them I'm I'm pretty excited about that and so can I can I use AI Studio to fine-tune with my images my collection of images yeah you're yeah we're going to get there okay and then I could could I give it load it all the things that I've written so that use it use it as my rag yeah yeah yeah basically okay and then every time I come back to it it loads up the it's memory again so it remembers where it left off last time yep and we carry on our conversation as as if nothing ever happened yeah and and and look I mean like any product it'll get better over time the tools for training it will get better it's not just about what you want it to say I mean I think generally creators and businesses have topics that they want to stay away from too right so just getting better at all this stuff um you know I think the platonic version of this is not just text right you you almost want to just be able to and this is sort of an intersection with some of the codec Avatar work that we're doing over time you want to basically be able to have almost like a video chat with with the um with the with the agent and I think we'll get there over time I don't think that this stuff is that far off but the um the flywheel is spinning really quickly so it's it's it's exciting um there is a lot of new stuff to build and I I think even if the progress on the foundation models kind of stopped now which I don't think it will I think we'd have like five years of product Innovation for the industry to basically figure out how to most effective use all the stuff that's gotten built so far but I actually just think the the kind of foundation models and the progress on the fundamental research is accelerating so um so that it's a it's a pretty wild time your vision of it's all it's all um you know you kind of made this happen so why thank you in the last conversation I I thank you yeah you know that you know we're CEOs we're we're delicate flowers we need a lot of back yeah we're we're pretty grizzled at this point I think we're we're the two kind of longest standing Founders in the industry right it's I mean it's true it's true it's true I just and your hair has gotten gray mine has just gotten longer mine's gotten gray yours gotten curly what's up it was always curly that's why I kept it short okay yeah I just if if I known it was going to take so long to succeed you never would have started no I would have dropped out of college just like you get a head start well that's a that's a good difference between our personalities I I think that these things you got a 12 year Head Start that's pretty good that's pretty good you know you're doing pretty well uh I'm gon to I'm going to be able to carry on let me just put it that way yes so so um I the the thing that I love about about um your vision of that everybody can have an AI that every business can have an AI in our company I want every engineer and every software developer to have an AI yeah and um or many AIS uh the thing that's that that I love about your vision is you also believe that everybody and every company should be able to make their own AI so you actually open sourced uh when you open source llama I thought that was great llama 2.1 by the way I I thought llama 2 was probably the biggest event in AI last year and the reason for that I I thought it was the h100 but you know it's a it's a chicken or the egg question that's a chicken or the egg yeah which came first the h100 no well llama 2 was was actually not the h100 yeah it was a100 yeah thank you and so so um uh but but the reason why I said was the biggest event was because when that came out it activated every company every Enterprise and every industry all of a sudden every Healthcare company was building AIS every company was building AI every large company small companies startups was were building AIS it made it possible for every researcher to be able to re-engage AI again because they have a starting point to do something with um and uh and then now uh 3.1 is out and the excitement just so you know uh you know we work together to to uh uh deploy uh 3.1 we're taking it out to the world's Enterprise and the excitement is just off the charts and and I I think it's going to enable all kinds of applications but tell tell me about your your open- Source philosophy where did I come from from and you know you open source pytorch yeah and that it is now the framework by which AI is done and and uh now you've open source llama 3.1 or llama uh there's a whole ecosystem built around it and so I think it's horrific but where did that all come from yeah so there's there's a bunch of history on on a lot of this I mean we've done a lot of Open Source work over time um I think part of it you know just bluntly is you know we got started after some of the other tech companies right in building out stuff like the distributed computing infrastructure and and the data centers and you know because of that by the time that we built that stuff it wasn't a competitive Advantage so we're like all right we might as well make this open and then we'll benefit from the from the ecosystem around that so we we had a bunch of projects like that I think the biggest one was probably open compute where we took our server designs the network designs and eventually the data center designs and published all of that and by having that become somewhat of an industry standard um all the supply chains basically got or organized around it which had this benefit of saving money for everyone so by making it public um and open we basically have saved billions of dollars from doing that work open compute was also what made it possible for NVIDIA hgx is that we design for one data center all a sudden Works in yeah Works in every data center awesome um so so we so that was an awesome experience and then you we've done it with a bunch of our kind of infrastructure tools things like react pie torch um so I'd say by the time that llama came around we were sort of positively predisposed towards doing this um for for AI models specifically I guess there's a few ways that I look at this I mean one is you know it's been really fun building stuff over the last 20 years at the company um one of the things that that has been sort of the most difficult has been kind of having to navigate the fact that we ship our apps through through our competitors mobile platforms so in the one hand the mobile platforms have been this huge Boon to the industry that's been awesome um on the other hand having to deliver your products through your competitors um is challenging right and and I also you know I grew up in a time where you know the first version of Facebook was on the web and that was open and then you know as it transitioned to mobile you know the plus side of that was you know now everyone has a computer in their pocket so that's great the downside is okay we're a lot more restricted in what we can do so when you look at these generation of computing there's this big recency bias where everyone just looks at mobile and thinks okay because the closed ecosystem because Apple basically won and set the the terms of that and like yeah I know that there's more Android phones out there technically but like apple basically has the whole Market um and and and like all the profits and and basically Android is kind of following Apple in terms of the development of it so I think Apple pretty clearly won this generation but it's not always like that right I me if you go back a generation um you Apple was doing their their kind of closed thing um but Microsoft which was you know it's it obviously isn't like this perfectly open company but you know compared to to to Apple with Windows running on all the different oems and different software uh and different different Hardware um was a much more open ecosystem and Windows Windows was the leading ecosystem it it um you know it it basically in the kind of PC generation of things the open ecosystem one and I am kind of hopeful that in the next generation of computing we're going to return to a Zone where the open ecosystem wins and is the leading one again there will always be a closed one and an open one I think that there's reasons to do both there are benefits to both I'm not like a zealot on this I mean we do closed Source stuff and not everything that we that we publish is open um but I think in general for the Computing platforms that the whole industry is building on there's a lot of value for that if the software especially is open so that's really shaped My Philosophy on this and um for both AI with llama and with the work that we're doing in AR and VR where we're basically making the Horizon OS that we're building for mixed reality um an an open operating system in the sense of of kind of what Android or or Windows was and and basically making it so that um like we're going to be able to work with lots of different Hardware companies to make all different kinds of of devices we basically just want to return the ecosystem to that level where that that's going to be the open one and and I I I'm pretty optimistic that the Next Generation the open ones are going to win for for us specifically um you know I just want to make sure that we have access to I mean this is sort of selfish but I mean it's you know after building this company for a while um one of my things for the next 10 or 15 years is like I just want to make sure that we can build the fundamental technology that we're going to be building social experiences on because there have just been too many things that I've tried to build and then have just been told nah you can't really Build That by the platform provider that at some level I'm just like nah that for the next Generation Um like we're going to go build like all all the way down and and make sure that that we there goes our broadcast opportunity yeah no sorry um sorry um like beep yeah you know we're doing okay for like 20 minutes but give me give me talking about closed platforms and I get angry um so um hey look it it is great I think it's a great world where where uh where there are people who are dedicated uh to build the best possible AI however they build it and they make they they offer it to the World um you know as a service and then but if you want to build your own AI you could still also build your own AI so the ability totally to right to use an AI you know there's a lot of stuff I prefer not to make this jacket myself I prefer to have this Jack made for me you know what I'm saying yeah yeah but so the fact that so the fact that leather could be open source is not a useful concept for me but but I I think the the idea that you could you could have great Services incredible Services as well as open Service open ability then then we basically have the entire Spectrum but the the thing that's that that that you did with 3.1 that was really great was you have 405b you have 70b you have 8B you could you could use it for synthetic data generation use the larger models to essentially teach the smaller models and although the larger models will be more General um it it's less brittle uh you could you could still build a smaller model that fits in you know whatever operating domain or operating cost that you would like to have uh you you uh uh met a guard I think llama guard llama guard for Guard railing fantastic um and so now and the way that that you built the model uh it's built in a transparent way it's uh has you dedicated you've got a world class safety team World Class ethics team uh you could build it in such a way that everybody knows it's built properly and so I really love that part of it yeah and I mean just to finish the thought from from before uh before I got I got Sidetrack there for detour um you know I do think there's this alignment where I we're building it because we want the thing to exist and we want to knock it cut off from some closed model right and um but it this isn't just like a piece of software that you can build it's you know you need an ecosystem around it and so it's it's almost like it it kind of almost wouldn't even work that well if we didn't open source it right it's it's not we're not doing this because we're kind of altruistic people um even though I I I think that this is going to be helpful for the ecosystem and we're doing it because we think that this is going to make the thing that we're building the best by by kind of having a robust ecosystem around how many people contributed to pytorch ecosystem yeah totally mountains of engineering yeah right yeah yeah Nvidia alone we probably have a couple of hundred people just dedicated to making P torch better and scalable and you know more performant and so on so forth yeah and it's it's also just when something becomes something of an industry standard other folks do work around it right so like all of the silicon and the systems will end up being optimized to run this thing really well which will benefit everyone but it will also work well with the system that we're building and that's I I think just one example of how this ends up being um just being really effective so yeah I mean I I think that the open source strategy is going to be is going to be a good one as a business strategy I I think people still don't quite get we we love it so much we built an ecosystem around it we built this thing called on this yeah yeah yeah you guys have been awesome on this I mean every time we're shipping something you guys are the first to to release this and and optimize it and make it work and so I mean I I appreciate that but what can what can I say we have good Engineers you know and so and and well you always just jump on the quickly too so well I you know I'm a I'm a senior citizen but I'm agile you know that's what CEOs have to do um and I recognize an important thing I recognize an important thing and and I I think that llama is genuinely important we built this concept to call an AI Factory uh AI Foundry around it uh so that we can help everybody build take you know a lot of people they they they have a desire to um uh uh build Ai and it's very important for them to own the AI because once they put put that into their their flywheel their data flywheel that's how their company's institutional knowledge is encoded and embedded into an an AI so they can't afford to have the AI flywheel the data flywheel that experienced flywheel somewhere else so and and so open source allows them to do that but they they don't really know how to turn this whole thing into an AI and so we created this thing called an AI Foundry we provide the tooling we provide the expertise uh llama uh technology uh we have the ability to help them uh turn this whole thing uh into an AI service and and then when when we're done with that uh they take it they own it we the output of it's what we call a Nim and this Nim this this neurom micro Nvidia inference micros Service uh they just download it they take it and they run it anywhere they like including on Prem and we have a whole ecosystem of Partners uh from oems that can run the NIMS to uh gsis like Accenture that that we've trained and work with to create llama based Nims and and uh and pipelines and and now we're we're off helping Enterprises all over the world do this I mean it's really quite an exciting thing it's really all triggered off of uh the Llama open sourcing yeah I think especially the ability to help people distill their own models from the big model is going to be a really valuable new thing because I I there's this you just like we talked about on the product side how at least I don't think that there's going to be like one major AI agent that everyone talks to it's at the same level I don't think that there's going to NE necessarily be one model that everyone uses we have a chip AI chip design AI we have a software coding Ai and our software coding AI understands uh USD because we code in USD for for Omniverse stuff um uh we have a software AI that understands verog our ver log um we have uh we have software AI that understands our bugs database and knows how to help us triage bugs and sends it to the right engineers and so each one of these AIS are fine-tuned off of llama and and so we find tune them we guardrail them you know if we if we have a if we have a an AI design for for uh for chip design uh we're not interested in asking it about politics you know and religion and things like that so we guardrail it and so so I think I think every company will essentially have for every single function that they have uh they will likely have AIS that are built for that and they need help to do that yeah I mean I think it's one of the big questions is going to be in the future to what extent are people just using the kind of the bigger more sophisticated models versus just training their own models for the uses that they have and at least I would bet that they are going to be just a a just vast proliferation of different models people we use the largest ones and the reason for that is because our Engineers are their times are so valuable and so we get uh right now we're getting 405b uh optimized for performance and as you know 405b doesn't fit in any GPU no matter how big and so that's why the MV link performance perance is so important we have this every one of our gpus connected by this nonblocking switch called MV link switch and um in the hgx for example there are two of those switches and we make it possible for all these all these gpus to work and and um uh run the 405 BS really performant the reason why we do it is because the the engineers times are so valuable to us you know we want to use the best possible model the fact that it's cost effective by a few pennies who cares and so we we we just want to make sure that the best qu quity of result is presented to them yeah well I mean the 405 I think is about half the cost to inference of the GPT 40 model so I mean at that level it's already I mean it's it's pretty good but yeah I mean I think people are doing stuff on devices or want smaller models they're just going to distill it down so that's like a whole different set of services that AI is running and let's let's pretend for a second that we're hiring that AI that AI for chip design is probably $10 an hour MH you're you're using you know and and uh uh um if you're using it constantly and you're sharing that AI across a whole bunch of Engineers so each engineer probably has an AI that's sitting sitting with them that cost you know doesn't cost very much and we pay the engineers a lot of money and so so to us a few dollars an hour uh amplifies the capabilities of somebody that's really valuable yeah yeah I mean you don't need to convince me if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't hired an AI do it right away that's all we're saying and so so um I I let's let's talk about let's talk about um the next the next wave um you know one of the things that I really love about the work that you guys do computer vision um uh one of the models that we use a lot internally uh is segment everything and um uh you know that that we're now train tring AI models on video so that we can understand the world model our use case our use cases for Robotics and and uh industrial industrial uh digitalization and um uh connecting these AI models into Omniverse so that we can we can um uh model and represent the physical world better uh have robots that operate in these Omniverse worlds better uh your your application uh uh the the Rayband metag glass um your vision for for bringing AI into the virtual world uh is really interesting tell us about that yeah well okay a lot to unpack in there um the segment anything model that that you're talking about we're actually presenting I think the next version of that here at at sigraph segment anything two um and it is it now works it's faster it works with um oh here we go um it works in video now as well I think the these are actually cattle from my Ranch in Kawaii um but by the way these are what they're called delicious delicious marks cows um there you go yeah another next time we do so Mark Mark came up to my house and we made Philly cheese steak together next time you're bringing the cow you did I was more of a sue Chef it was really good it was really good that suf comment okay listen and then at the end of the night though you were like hey so you you you ate enough right and I was like I don't know I could eat another one you're like really you know usually when you say something like you were being I was definitely like yeah we're making more we're making more she did you get enough to eat usually your guest says oh yeah that I'm fine make me another cheese steak Jensen so just to let you know how OCD he is so I turn around I'm I'm prepping the the the cheese steak and said Mark cut the tomatoes and so so Mark I handed him a knife yeah I'm I'm a Precision cutter and so he cuts he cuts the uh the tomatoes every single one of them are perfectly to the exact millimeter but the really interesting thing is I was expecting all the tomatoes to be sliced and kind of stacked up kind of like a a deck of cards and uh but when I turned around he said he needed another another plate and the reason for that was because all of the tomatoes he cut none of them touched each other once he separates one slice of tomato from The Other Tomato they shall not touch again yeah look man if you wanted them to touch you needed to tell me that right why I'm just the Sue Chef okay that's why he needs an AI that doesn't judge yeah it's like so this is super cool okay so it's recognizing the cows track it's recognizing tracking the cows yeah yeah so it's um a lot of fun effects will be able to be made with this and because it'll be open a lot of more serious applications across the industry too so I mean scientists use this stuff to you know study um like coral reefs and natural habitats and um and kind of evolution of Landscapes and things like that but I mean it's uh being able to do this in video and having it be zero shot and be able to kind of interact with it and tell it what you want to track is um it's it's it's pretty cool research so for example the reason why we use it uh for example you have a warehouse and it's got a whole bunch of cameras and the warehouse uh AI uh is watching everything that's going on and let's say a uh you know a stack of Boxes Fell uh or somebody spilled water on the ground um or you know what whatever accident is about to happen the AI recognizes it generates the text send it to somebody and you know uh you know help will come along the way and so that's one way of using it uh instead of recording everything if there's an accident and started recording every nanc a video and then going back and re retrieve that moment it just it just records the important stuff because it knows what it's looking at and so so having a vi video understanding model a video language model is really really powerful for all all these these interesting applications now what else what else are you guys going to work on Beyond uh Ray talk talk to me about yeah so there's all the smart glasses right so I think when we think about the next Computing platform you know we kind of break it down into mixed reality the headsets and the smart glasses and the smart glasses I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around that and wearing it because it's you know pretty much everyone who's wearing a pair of glasses today will end up that'll get upgraded to smart glasses and that's like more than a billion people in the world so that's going to be a pretty big thing um the VMR headsets I think some people find it interesting for gaming or different uses some don't yet my view is that they're going to be both in world I think the smart glasses are going to be sort of the mobile phone kind of always on version of the next Computing platform and the mixed reality headsets are going to be more like your workstation or your game console where when you're sitting down for a more immersive session and you want access to more compute I mean look I mean the glasses are just very small form factor um there going to be a lot of constraints on that just like you can't do the same level of computing on a phone came at exactly the time when all of these breakthroughs in generative AI happened yeah so we we basically for smart classes we've been we've been going at the problem from two different directions on the one hand we've been building what we think is sort of the technology that you need for the kind of Ideal holographic AR glasses and we're doing all the custom silicon work all the custom display stack work like all the stuff that you would need to do to make that work and they're glasses right it's not a headset it's not like a VR or Mr headset they look like glasses but um they're still quite a bit far off from the glasses that you're wearing now I mean those are very thin but um but even even the rayb bands that we that we make you couldn't quite fit all the tech that you need to into that yet for kind of full holographic AR though we're getting close and over the next few years I think we'll we'll basically get closer it'll still be pretty expensive but but I think that'll start to be a product um the other angle that we've come at this is let's start with good-look glasses by partnering with the Best glasses maker in the world es luoda they basically make they have all all the big brands that you use um you know with it's rayan or Oakley or Oliver pees or just like a handful of others kind of all L luoda the Nvidia of glasses um I I think that you know it's um I think they would probably like that analogy but um I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't at this point um but I so we've been working with them on on the rayb bands we're on the second generation and the goal there has been okay let's constrain the form factor to just something that looks great great idea and within that let's put in as much technology as we can understanding that we're not going to get to the kind of ideal of what we want to fit into it technically but it'll it'll but at the end it'll be like great looking glasses and we at this point we have we have camera sensors so you can you can take photos and videos you can actually live stream to Instagram you can take video calls on WhatsApp and stream to the other person um you know what you're seeing um you can I mean it has it has a microphone and speaker so I mean the speaker is actually really good it's open ear so you a lot of people find it more comfortable than than earbuds um you can listen to music and it's just like this private experience that's pretty neat people love that you take phone calls on it um but then it just turned out that that sensor package was exactly what you needed to be able to talk to AI too yeah so that was sort of an accident if you'd asked me five years ago were we gonna get holographic AR before AI I would have said yeah probably right I mean it's it just seems like kind of the graphics progression and the display progression on all the virtual and mixed reality stuff and building up the new display stack we were just making continual progress towards that that's right and then this breakthrough happened with llms and it turned out that we have sort of really high quality AI now and getting better at a really fast rate before you have holographic AR so it's sort of this inversion that that I didn't really expect I mean we're we're fortunately well positioned because we were working on all these different products but I think what you're going to end up with is um just a whole series of different potential glasses products at different price points with different levels of technology in them so I kind of think um based on what we're seeing now with the Rayband metas I I would guess that display AI glasses MH at like a $300 price point are going to be a really big product that like tens of millions of people or hundreds of millions of people eventually are going to have um and you're going to have super interactive AI that you're talking to you have visual you have visual language understanding that you just showed you have realtime translation you could talk to me in one language I hear it in another language yeah then the display is obviously going to be great too but it's going to add a little bit of weight to the glasses and it's going to make them more expensive so I think for there will be a lot of people who want the kind of full holographic display but there are also going to be a lot of people for whom um you know they they want something that eventually is going to be like really thin glasses and well for industrial applications and for some work applications we need that we need I think for Consumer stuff too you think so yeah I mean I I think you know it's I was thinking about this a lot during the you know during covid when when everyone kind of went remote for a bit it's like you're spending all this time on Zoom it's like okay this is like it's great that we have this but um but in the future we're like not that many years away from being able to have a virtual meeting where like you know it's like I'm not here physically it's just my hologram and like it just feels like we're there and we're physically present we can work on something and collaborate on something together but I think this is going to be especially important with AI I could live with with a a device that that I'm not wearing all the time oh yeah but I think we're going to get to the point where it actually is I could it'll be I mean there's with within glasses there's like thinner frames and there's thicker frames and there's like all these Styles but um so I don't I think we're we're a while away from having full holographic glasses in the form factor of your glasses but I think having it in a pair of stylish kind of chunkier framed glasses is not that far off these sunglasses are the face size these days I could see that yeah and and you know what that's that's a very helpful style track exactly that's a very helpful whoever you know it's like like I'm I'm trying to you know TR make my way into becoming like a style influencer so I can like influence this before um you know before the glasses come to the market but you know well I can see you attempting it how's your style influencing working out for you you know it's early yeah it's um it's early it's early um but I don't know I feel like if if if a big part of the future of the business is going to be building um kind of stylish glasses that people wear um this is something I should probably start paying a little more attention to right then we're going to have to retire the version of me that we're the same thing every day but I mean that's the thing about glasses too I I think it's um you know it's unlike you know even the watch or or phones like people really do not want to all look the same right and and it's like so I do think that it's you know it's it's a it's a platform that I think is going to lend itself going back to the theme that we talked about before towards being an open ecosystem because I think the diversity of form factors that people and styles that people are going to demand is going to be immense um it's not like everyone is not going to want to put like the one kind of pair of glasses that you know whoever else designs like that's not I don't think that's going to fly for this yeah I think that's right well Mark it's sort of incredible that we're living through a time where where the entire Computing stack is re being reinvented how we think about software you know what what Andre calls software one and software 2 and now we're basically in software 3 now the way we compute um from general purpose Computing to these generative neural network processing way of doing Computing um the capabilities the applications we could develop now are Unthinkable in the past and and this technology generative AI uh I don't remember another technology that that in such a fast rate influenced consumers Enterprise Industries and science yeah and to be able to to cut across cut across um all these different fields of science from from climate Tech to U biotech um uh to uh physical sciences uh in every single field that we're encountered uh generative AI is is right at the middle of that uh fundamental transition and and it's and and in addition to that uh the things that you're talking about generative AI is going to make a a profound impact in society you know the products that we're making and one of the things that I'm s super excited about and somebody asked me earlier is there going to be a you know gents and AI um well that's exactly the creative AI you were talking about you know where we just build our own AIS and I I load it up with all of the things that I've written and and I I fine-tune it with with uh uh with the way I answer questions and and uh and hopefully hopefully over time the accumulation of use and you know becomes a really really great assistant and companion for for uh uh for a whole lot of people who just wants to you know ask questions or um bounce ideas off of and and it'll be the version of Jensen that as as you were saying earlier that's that's not judgmental you're not afraid of being judged and so you could come and interact with it all the time but but I I just think I think that th those are real really incredible things and and you know we we write we write a lot of things all the time and and how incredible is it just to give it you know three or four topics these are the basic themes of what I want to write about and write it in my voice and just use that as a starting point so there's there's just so many things that we can do now uh it it's really terrific working with you and uh uh I I know that I know that uh it's not easy building a company and you pivoted yours from desktop to mobile to VR to AI all these devices uh it's really really really extraordinary to watch and Nvidia pivoted many times ourselves and I know exactly how hard it is doing that and uh um you know both of us have have gotone kicked in our teeth a lot plenty over the years but that's that's what it takes to to uh uh to want to be a Pioneer and and innovate so it's really great watching you well and likewise I mean it's like it's I'm not sure if it's a pivot if you keep doing the thing you were doing before but but is as well but it's but you add to it I mean there's more chapters to all the to to all this and I think the same thing for it's been fun watching I me the journey that you guys have been on I mean just and you went we went through this period where everyone was like nah everything is going to kind of move to these devices and you know just going to get super kind of cheap compute and and you guys just kept on plugging away at this and it's like no like actually you're going to want these big systems that can that can paralyze we went the other way yeah no and it's I mean yeah we went and instead of building smaller and smaller devices we make computers as size unfashionable for a while a little unfashionable super unfashionable yeah yeah but now now it's cool and and instead of in you know we started building a graphics chip a GPU and and now when you when uh when you're deploying a GPU you still call it Hopper h100 but so you guys know when when when Zuck calls it h100 his data center of h100s there's like I think you're coming up on 600,000 and and they're we're good customers that's how you get the Jensen Q&A at sigraph wow hang on that I was getting the Mark Zuckerberg Q&A you were my guest and I wanted to make sure that that you just called me one day and you're like hey yeah you know in like a couple of weeks we're doing this thing at sigar I'm like yeah I don't think I'm doing anything that day to Denver it sounds fun exactly I'm not doing anything that afternoon you showed up and and uh but but the thing the thing is just incredible these these systems that you guys build uh they're they giant systems incredibly hard to orchestrate incredibly hard to to run and you know you said that that you got into the GPU uh Journey later than than most but you're operating larger than just about anybody and it's it's incredible to watch and congratulations on everything that you've done and uh you you are quite the style icon now check check out this guy huh early stage working on it working on it it's a ladies and gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg thank you hang on hang on well um you know you know um so turns out the last time that we got together after dinner Mark Mark and I I where Jersey swap Jersey Swap and and uh we took a picture and and turned in it turned into something viral and um and now I thought that he he has no trouble wearing my jacket I don't know is that my look I don't think I can should be it should be is that right yeah I actually I um I made one for you you did you did yeah that one's marks I mean hey let's see we got we got a box back here it's black and leather and sheering oh I didn't make this I just ordered it online hang on a second hang on a second it's a little chilly in here I think I'll try this on I think this is my goodness I mean this is that's a it's a Vibe you just need is this me we'll be pretty I mean get this guy a chain all right next time I see you I'm bring you a gold chain so fair is fair so I let you know I I was telling everybody that Lori bought me a new jacket to celebrate this year's sigraph sigraph is is a big thing in our company as you could imagine RTX was launched here amazing things were launched here and this is a brand new jacket it's literally 2 hours old wow and so I think we had a jersey swap again all right well this one's yours I mean this is worth more cuz it's used let's see I don't know I don't I think I think Mark is pretty buff he's the guy's pretty jacked I mean you too man all right all right everybody gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg have a great Sig oh\n'''","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-19T13:49:46.761030Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-19T13:49:46.761490Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-19T13:49:47.178593Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-19T13:49:46.761438Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-19T13:49:47.177510Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"all_info

welcome to CES 2024. We'll begin with GeForce RTXand then cover robotics. Let's get started. Welcome to our world. Where every play, every moment, and every detail matters. From creating new worlds, to epic solo adventures and chaotic multiplayer showdowns, we take you beyond the edge. And by uniting fearless innovation with the power of AI, you’re charged with superpowers, making every move momentous, and bringing every concept to life. RTX, it’s on. NVIDIA has led PC gaming and content creationthrough three decades of technology breakthroughs and performance gains of 10 million X. There are now over 200 million gamersand creators worldwide who count on GeForcepowered desktops and laptops. Today, NVIDIA is at the centerof the latest technology transformation: Generative AI. Gen AI presents an opportunityfar larger than the Internet. It will change how we interact with games. It will speed up creative workflowsand will give everyone a co-pilot to make us all more productive. NVIDIA’s journey in AI began in 2006. We launched the GeForce 8800 GTX. Designed to play the most challenging video games, it proved it could certainly run Crysis. The 8800 architecture alsointroduced CUDA cores, allowing researchers and developers everywhere to program the GPU for non-graphical applications. In 2012, a team of researchersfrom the University of Toronto made an incredible discovery. The GeForce GTX 580 GPU, best known for running games like Call of Duty,could be programmed with CUDA to run a convolutional neural network,an early innovation in deep learning. In fact, the GTX 580 crushedthe record in the famed ImageNet Image Recognition contest, and the era of GPU-acceleratedDeep Learning had begun. NVIDIA launched RTX in 2018and set in motion a giant leap in graphics—real time ray tracing. Ten years in the making! It combined RT cores used to process rays,with tensor cores, used for AI-powered Deep LearningSuper Sampling, or DLSS. The ray-traced Star WarsReflections experience, which previously required four NVIDIA V100data center GPUs at a price tag of $60,000, was now possibleon a single GeForce RTX GPU. We continued to invest in ray tracing and AI. From its launch in 2018, RTX AI performance has increased 10X to 1300 Tera-ops, or TOPs. Now with DLSS 3.5, seven out of every eight pixels aregenerated by AI, accelerating full ray tracing by up to 4Xwith better image quality. Last year, AI made a dramatic leapto the mainstream. ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion inspiredan unprecedented investment in training and inference of new generative AI models. With a 100 million shipped,RTX GPUs provide a massive installed base for AI applications. In October, NVIDIA released our TensorRT LLM library for Windows, accelerating large language modelslike Llama 2 and Mistral up to 5X on RTX PCs. With our new Chat with RTX playground, enthusiasts can connect an RTX-acceleratedLLM to documents or YouTube videos using retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, and chat away. We are also introducing TensorRTacceleration for Stable Diffusion XL and SDXL Turbo in the popularAutomatic1111 app, providing up to 60% boost in performance. Looking forward,AI experiences will be delivered with a hybrid of cloudand PC computation. Hybrid AI will use NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud to run the largest language models, while taking advantage ofRTX tensor cores on your PC to run latency-sensitive applications. We are already seeing hybrid AI in action. For video conferencing, Microsoft Teams offers Copilot,an assistant running in the cloud, while NVIDIA Broadcast runs locally for noise removal and virtual backgrounds. For content creation, Adobe Photoshop includesFirefly-powered Generative Fill running in the cloud, while RTX GPUspower AI tools on the PC. And in gaming, a combination of AI in the cloud and PCwill pull you deeper into the story. Last year, we introduced ACE, our platformfor AI-powered game characters. Let me turn it over to Sethfor more detail. Thanks, Jeff. NVIDIA ACE is a technology platformthat brings digital avatars to life with generative AI. ACE AI models are designed to run in the cloud or locally on the PC. Let's walk through an interactionwith a game character. First, we start with the player's voice input. That prompt is then passed to our automatic speech recognition model,which translates speech to text. Then we feed that text into a large language modelto generate the character's response. After that, the text response is vocalizedusing a text-to-speech model which is then passed to an animation modelto create a realistic lip sync. Finally, the dynamic character is renderedinto the game scene. Here at CES, we are announcingACE Production Microservices for Audio2Face and Automatic Speech Recognition. Available now, each model can be incorporated by our developers individually into their own pipelines. We are working with top digital avatardevelopers to bring NVIDIA ACE technology to gamers. Our latest collaboration is with Convai, a developer platform that enables easy integration of GenAI-powered game characters. Convai’s platform features a set of tools and APIs to create character personas and enable dynamic conversations leveraging the new NVIDIA Audio2faceand Riva microservices. The latest features from Convai enable real-time character-to-character interaction, scene perception, and actions. Let's take a look. In this demo, we're back in the ramen shop with Jin. Except this time we're joined by Nova,a cybersecurity expert in our cyberpunk-flavored world. Let’s listen in as these two AI game characters have a generated conversation. [JIN]Nova, you ever get that uncanny feeling we’re like those AI constructsfrom the old sci-fi flicks? But nah, we’re too quirky for that. [SETH, off-screen]The cool thing is the conversationis different every time. [NOVA]Quirky is one word for it, Jin. I think we're just too real to be anythingbut flesh and blood. You're not wrong, Jin. Sometimes I wonder if we're all just partof some elaborate cybernetic dream. If we were AI’s, I'd be the onecracking jokes about the singularity over a bowl of ramen. Kai. Long time no see. You've been hiding in the shadows. Or have you just been trying to avoid me? [SETH]Hey, Nova, it's good to see you. I haven't been trying to avoid you.Just been super busy. How are things? [NOVA]Things are fantastic. Just secured a juicy contractwith Zenith & Sons. [SETH]Hey Jin, you hear that? Nova just landed a big contract. Let's break out the good stuff. [JIN]Ah, you got it, Kai. Nova’s success calls for the top shelfcelebration. Just don't expect this to become a habit. [SETH]Thanks, Jin. So, Nova, have you been playing any games recently? [NOVA] I've been testing this cool game techon a secret new GPU that's launching very soon. I can't talk about it here,but I can show you at the lab. [SETH]Wow, that sounds super cool. Yeah, I'd love to see the game tech. Let's go back to your lab. [NOVA]Absolutely. Follow me and prepare to be blown awayby what you're about to see. With Convai’s latest framework, game characters can now interact with the scene by fetching objects and navigating the world, all based on your conversation. Over to you, Kristina. Thank you, Seth. So many exciting new developmentsin gaming and it doesn't end there. I'm thrilled to share that we nowhave over 500 RTX games and apps. This includes Alan Wake 2, which wonthree awards at this year's Game Awards. And we just keep growing. Horizon Forbidden West, the criticallyacclaimed sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, will be coming to PC early this year with the Burning Shoresexpansion accelerated by DLSS 3. RTX Gamers will race to savethe planet’s crumbling biosphere. Let's take a look. Looks like the rebels just got a lot more firepower. Pax Dei is a social sandbox MMO inspired by the legendsof the medieval era, where myths are real, ghostsexist, and magic is unquestioned. Developed by mainframe industrieswith veterans from CCP games, Blizzard, and Remedy Entertainment,Pax Dei will launch in early access on PC with AI-acceleratedDLSS 3 in Spring 2024. Here's a peek at never-before-seen gameplay. Last summer, Diablo IV launched with DLSS 3 and immediately became Blizzard's fastestselling game of all time. I am pleased to announce that ray tracingis coming to Diablo IV this March. Here's an exclusive look with RTX On. Our partnership with Activisiondoesn't end there. It also extends to the cloud with GeForce NOW. In November, we welcomedthe first Activision Blizzard game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,day-and-date with its PC release. The lineup will only continue to growwith Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 coming soon. We will continue to release top titlesfrom around the globe like Honkai Star Rail and Pax Dei. Today I am also excited to announce day passes coming to our membership optionsstarting in February. Priority and Ultimate Day Passeswill give gamers a full day of gaming with fastest accessto our servers. At the intersection of gamingand creating is NVIDIA’s modding platform, RTX Remix. There are over 10 billion gamemods downloaded each year. With Remix, modders can remaster their favorite classic games with full ray tracing and DLSS 3, and use generative AI tools to transforma classic game's low resolution texturesinto 4K physically accurate materials. We are excited to announcethat the RTX remix app will be releasing an openbeta on January 22nd. The Community Mod Team, Orbifold Studios, is using RTX Remix to reimagine one of the greatestgames of all time, Half-Life 2. Let's check out their latest trailerfor a first look at Ravenholm with DLSS 3.5. Back to you, Jeff. Thanks, Kristina.

Twitch is one of the most popular platformsfor content creators, with over 7M streamers going liveeach month to 35M daily viewers. These viewers are on all kinds of devicesand Internet services, yet many Twitch streamers are limited to broadcastingat a single resolution and quality level. As a result, they must broadcastat lower quality to reach more viewers. Twitch, OBS, and NVIDIA are announcingEnhanced Broadcasting. This new feature will allow streamersto transmit up to five concurrent streams to Twitchat different resolutions and quality, so each viewer can receivethe optimal experience. Twitch Enhanced Broadcastwill be supported on all RTX GPUs. Beta signups start todayand will go live later this month. Twitch will also experimentwith 4K and AV1 on GeForce RTX 40-series to deliver even better qualityand higher resolution streaming. Today we are announcing the SUPER series. Let's take a look. This is the RTX 4080 Super. For gamers, it can power fullyray traced games at 4K. It is 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Tiwithout frame gen, in the most graphically intensive games. With 836 AI TOPs, DLSS frame generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the 4080 Supertwice as fast as a 3080 Ti. Creators can generate video with stable video diffusion 1.5x faster and images with stable diffusionexcel 1.7x faster. The RTX 4080 Super featuresmore cores and faster memory, giving it a performance edgeat a great new price of $999. The RTX 4080 Super will be availableJanuary 31st. Next up is the RTX 4070 Ti Super. We've added more coresand increased the frame buffer to 16GB and the memory bus to 256 bits. It's the perfect GPU to max out your highrefresh 1440p panels and even game at 4K.

We also announced a new wave of AI-readyRTX laptops from every major OEM, delivering the ultimate in mobile performance. A new era of PC computing is here, and it will transform everything we do. NVIDIA and our partners are excitedfor what comes next! And now we will hear from Deepu Tallaabout a new era for robotics. Thanks, Jeff. I would like to share how the infusionof generative AI into robotics is speeding up the ability to bring robotsfrom proof-of-concept to real-world deployment. For the past few years, autonomous robotspowered by artificial intelligence are being increasingly utilizedfor improving efficiency, decreasing costs and tackling labor shortages. Logistics, warehouses, and manufacturing are the first use casesthat had the biggest need. And today, we can seehundreds of thousands of deployed robots, with each of them getting smarteras time goes on due to AI updates. Large-scale fulfillment centersand manufacturing plants that are millions of square feet in area continue to add more smart robots. The next wave of industries for AI-powered smart robotsinclude agriculture, construction, healthcare, and retail. In the last 12 months, generative AI has revolutionized text andnatural language processing. The introduction of ChatGPT has beennoted as the iPhone moment of AI. Very soon we are at the tipping pointof the same technology coming to computer vision and robotics. Generative AI models achieve higher accuracywhile generalizing rather well and applications are builtusing natural language prompts or text. Given these attributes, generativeAI is well-suited for robotics. Now let's see how NVIDIA is bringingthe massive potential of generative AI to robotics. Our platform for building AI-poweredrobots is called NVIDIA Isaac. To deploy AI, there are two computers necessary. The AI factory is where the simulation and training of the AI model happens. It is essentiallythe creation of the model. This process can go on throughoutthe operating life of the robot. The AI model can be continuously improvedso that it gets better and better, more accurate, more performant,and more generalizable. Some applications might demand the AI model to be fine-tuned round-the-clock,365-days-a-year. For example,if you are operating a fleet of autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs,that are marching towards the goal of full autonomy. On the other end of the spectrum, the AI model only needs to beupdated occasionally, and as a result, re-training happensperiodically. For example, a robotic vacuum cleanerthat needs to adapt to your home floor plan. The AI Factory leverages NVIDIA’s data centercompute infrastructure, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Now let's switch to the second computer,which is the run-time of the robot. The computer can be an on-premise server. For example, performing defect inspectionfor a high-speed semiconductor manufacturing line. Or the computer can be an autonomous machine processor,such as an NVIDIA Jetson, powering an AMR or industrialARM with multiple sensors such as 4 to 8 cameras,multiple 2D lidars, 3D lidar, and IMU. Over the past year,we have seen how generative AI-powered chatbots and copilotscan improve our productivity. Applying generativeAI to robotics will be transformative to accelerating the developmentand deployment of smarter robots. If we think back to our two-computermodel, let's see how generative AI, when combined with NVIDIA Omniverserunning in the AI factory, enhances simulation. We are seeing that LLMs caneliminate bottlenecks and turn typical usersinto technical artists. Whether it's creating an individualrobotic work cell or a full-scale manufacturing facility, simulation teamsmake a significant investment to build the right 3D digital twin to test and train their virtual robots. Leveraging the ability to reason andgenerate code with an LLM like ChatGPT the desired scene can be createdfrom a text prompt in minutes. Under the hood,all of the available assets can be utilized and placed in the scenein meaningful ways. Robots often operate indynamic environments, so even after the scene is created,new 3D assets will need to be generated. Starting with NVIDIA's Picasso, a text-to-3Dasset generative AI model, new realistic assets can be generated from a text prompt and placed in the scene. When testing or training a robot, diversity in environments is essential to ensure the robot can generalizeto the real world. Starting with text prompts,generative AI can add rain, water, rust,and more to existing environments and create thousandsof physically accurate scenarios. Tasks that typically take a technical artist days can be completed in minutes. It doesn't end there. Generative AI can act as your copilot when it comes to writing scripts. Simply enter the prompt and generatethe necessary code to run robot simulations or generatesynthetic data that is auto-labeled, saving enormous amounts of expense and time. All of this capability is available or coming soon with NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac Sim. Make sure you leverage itif you're not already doing so. We showed you how Generative AI is supercharging robot simulationand synthetic data generation in the AI factory. Now let's see how generative AI can turbocharge the run-timecapabilities of robots. LLMs and LVMs are making it possible for humans to interact with robotsusing natural language. A generative AI model trained withvideo, text, and other modalities is able to generalize well andachieve higher accuracy than multiple purpose-built CNN-based computer vision models. Let's see how some of our partners are driving the generative AI revolution for their robotic operations. Thank you for tuning in and enjoy CES 2024. How many calculations do you think your graphics card performs every second while running video games with incredibly realistic graphics? Maybe 100 million? Well, 100 million calculations a second is what’s required to run Mario 64 from 1996. We need more power. Maybe 100 billion calculations a second? Well, then you would have a computer that could run Minecraft back in 2011. In order to run the most realistic video games such as Cyberpunk 2077 you need a graphics card that can perform around 36 trillion calculations a second. This is an unimaginably large number, so let’s take a second to try to conceptualize it. Imagine doing a long multiplication problem once every second. Now let’s say everyone on the planet does a similar type of calculation but with different numbers. To reach the equivalent computational power of this graphics card and its 36 trillion calculations a second we would need about 4,400 Earths filled with people, all working together and completing one calculation each every second. It’s rather mind boggling to think that a device can manage all these calculations, so in this video we’ll see how graphics cards work in two parts. First, we’ll open up this graphics card and explore the different components inside, as well as the physical design and architecture of the GPU or graphics processing unit. Second, we’ll explore the computational architecture and see how GPUs process mountains of data, and why they’re ideal for running video game graphics, Bitcoin mining, neural networks and AI.So, stick around and let’s jump right in. This video is sponsored by Micron which manufactures the graphics memory inside this graphics card.Before we dive into all the parts of the GPU, let’s first understand the differences between GPUs and CPUs. Inside this graphics card, the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU has over 10,000 cores. However, when we look at the CPU or Central Processing Unit that’s mounted to the motherboard, we find an integrated circuit or chip with only 24 cores. So, which one is more powerful? 10 thousand is a lot more than 24, so you would think the GPU is more powerful, however, it’s more complicated than that. A useful analogy is to think of a GPU as a massive cargo ship and a CPU as a jumbo jet airplane. The amount of cargo capacity is the amount of calculations and data that can be processed, and the speed of the ship or airplane is the rate at which how quickly those calculations and data are being processed. Essentially, it’s a trade-off between a massive number of calculations that are executed at a slower rate versus a few calculations that can be performed at a much faster rate.Another key difference is that airplanes are a lot more flexible since they can carry passengers, packages, or containers and can take off and land at any one of tens of thousands of airports. Likewise CPUs are flexible in that they can run a variety of programs and instructions. However, giant cargo ships carry only containers with bulk contents inside and are limited to traveling between ports. Similarly, GPUs are a lot less flexible than CPUs and can only run simple instructions like basic arithmetic. Additionally GPUs can’t run operating systems or interface with input devices or networks. This analogy isn’t perfect, but it helps to answer the question of “which is faster, a CPU or a GPU?�. Essentially if you want to perform a set of calculations across mountains of data, then a GPU will be faster at completing the task. However, if you have a lot less data that needs to be evaluated quickly than a CPU will be faster. Furthermore, if you need to run an operating system or support network connections and a wide range of different applications and hardware, then you’ll want a CPU. We’re planning a separate video on CPU architecture, so make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss it, but let’s now dive into this graphics card and see how it works. In the center of this graphics card is the printed circuit board or PCB, with all the various components mounted on it, [Animator Note: Highlight and list out the various parts that will be covered.] and we’ll start by exploring the brains which is the graphics processing unit or GPU. When we open it up, we find a large chip or die named GA102 built from 28.3 billion transistors. The majority of the area of the chip is taken up by the processing cores which have a hierarchical organization. Specifically, the chip is divided into 7 Graphics Processing Clusters or GPCs, and within each processing cluster are 12 streaming multiprocessors or SMs. Next, inside each of these streaming multiprocessors are 4 warps and 1 ray tracing core, and then, inside each warp are 32 Cuda or shading cores and 1 tensor core. Across the entire GPU are 10752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor Cores, and 84 Ray Tracing Cores. These three types of cores execute all the calculations of the GPU, and each has a different function. CUDA cores can be thought of as simple binary calculators with an addition button, a multiply button and a few others, and are used the most when running video games. Tensor cores are matrix multiplication and addition calculators and are used for geometric transformations and working with neural networks and AI. And ray tracing cores are the largest but the fewest and are used to execute ray tracing algorithms. Now that we understand the computational resources inside this chip, one rather interesting fact is that the 3080, 3090, 3080 ti, and 3090 ti graphics cards all use the same GA102 chip design for their GPU. This might be counterintuitive because they have different prices and were released in different years, but it’s true. So, why is this? Well, during the manufacturing process sometimes patterning errors, dust particles, or other manufacturing issues cause damage and create defective areas of the circuit. Instead of throwing out the entire chip because of a small defect, engineers find the defective region and permanently isolate and deactivate the nearby circuitry. By having a GPU with a highly repetitive design, a small defect in one core only damages that particular streaming multiprocessor circuit and doesn’t affect the other areas of the chip. As a result, these chips are tested and categorized or binned according to the number of defects. The 3090ti graphics cards have flawless GA102 chips with all 10752 CUDA cores working properly, the 3090 has 10,496 cores working, the 3080ti has 10,240 and the 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores working, which is equivalent to having 16 damaged and deactivated streaming multiprocessors. Additionally, different graphics cards differ by their maximum clock speed and the quantity and generation of graphics memory that supports the GPU, which we’ll explore in a little bit. Because we’ve been focusing on the physical architecture of this GA102 GPU chip, let’s zoom into one of these CUDA cores and see what it looks like. Inside this simple calculator is a layout of approximately 410 thousand transistors. This section of 50 thousand transistors performs the operation of A times B plus C which is called fused multiply and add or FMA and is the most common operation performed by graphics cards. Half of the CUDA cores execute FMA using 32-bit floating-point numbers, which is essentially scientific notation, and the other half of the cores use either 32-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers. Other sections of this core accommodate negative numbers and perform other simple functions like bit-shifting and bit masking as well as collecting and queueing the incoming instructions and operands, and then accumulating and outputting the results. As a result, this single core is just a simple calculator with a limited number of functions. This calculator completes one multiply and one add operation each clock cycle and therefore with this 3090 graphics cards and its 10496 cores and 1.7 gigahertz clock, we get 35.6 trillion calculations a second. However, if you’re wondering how the GPU handles more complicated operations like division, square root, and trigonometric functions, well, these calculator operations are performed by the special function units which are far fewer as only 4 of them can be found in each streaming multiprocessor. Now that we have an understanding of what’s inside a single core, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other sections of the GA102 chip. Around the edge we find 12 graphics memory controllers, the NVLink Controllers and the PCIe interface. On the bottom is a 6-megabyte Level 2 SRAM Memory Cache, and here’s the Gigathread Engine which manages all the graphics processing clusters and streaming multiprocessors inside. Now that we’ve explored this GA102 GPU’s physical architecture, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other parts inside the graphics card. On this side are the various ports for the displays to be plugged into, on the other side is the incoming 12 Volt power connector, and then here are the PCIe pins that plug into the motherboard. On the PCB, the majority of the smaller components constitute the voltage regulator module which takes the incoming 12 volts and converts it to one point one volts and supplies hundreds of watts of power to the GPU. Because all this power heats up the GPU, most of the weight of the graphics card is in the form of a heat sink with 4 heat pipes that carry heat from the GPU and memory chips to the radiator fins where fans then help to remove the heat. Perhaps some of the most important components, aside from the GPU, are the 24 gigabytes of graphics memory chips which are technically called GDDR6X SDRAM and were manufactured by Micron which is the sponsor of this video. Whenever you start up a video game or wait for a loading screen, the time it takes to load is mostly spent moving all the 3D models of a particular scene or environment from the solid-state drive into these graphics memory chips. As mentioned earlier, the GPU has a small amount of data storage in its 6-megabyte shared Level 2 cache which can hold the equivalent of about this much of the video game’s environment. Therefore in order to render a video game, different chunks of scene are continuously being transferred between the graphics memory and the GPU. Because the cores are constantly performing tens of trillions of calculations a second, GPUs are data hungry machines and need to be continuously fed terabytes upon terabytes of data, and thus these graphics memory chips are designed kind of like multiple cranes loading a cargo ship at the same time. Specifically, these 24 chips transfer a combined 384 bits at a time, which is called the bus width and the total data that can be transferred, or the bandwidth is about 1.15 terabytes a second. In contrast the sticks of DRAM that support the CPU only have a 64-bit bus width and a maximum bandwidth closer to 64 gigabytes a second. One rather interesting thing is that you may think that computers only work using binary ones and zeros. However, in order to increase data transfer rates, GDDR6X and the latest graphics memory, GDDR7 send and receive data across the bus wires using multiple voltage levels beyond just 0 and 1. For example, GDDR7 uses 3 different encoding schemes to combine binary bits into ternary digits or PAM-3 symbols with voltages of 0, 1, and negative 1. Here’s the encoding scheme on how 3 binary bits are encoded into 2 ternary digits and this scheme is combined with an 11 bit to 7 ternary digit encoding scheme resulting in sending 276 binary bits using only 176 ternary digits. The previous generation, GDDR6X, which is the memory in this 3090 graphics card, used a different encoding scheme, called PAM-4, to send 2 bits of data using 4 different voltage levels, however, engineers and the graphics memory industry agreed to switch to PAM-3 for future generations of graphics chips in order to reduce encoder complexity, improve the signal to noise ratio, and improve power efficiency. Micron delivers consistent innovation to push the boundaries on how much data can be transferred every second and to design cutting edge memory chips. Another advancement by Micron is the development of HBM, or the high bandwidth memory, that surrounds AI chips. HBM is built from stacks of DRAM memory chips and uses TSVs or through silicon vias, to connect this stack into a single chip, essentially forming a cube of AI memory. For the latest generation of high bandwidth memory, which is HBM3E, a single cube can have up to 24 to 36 gigabytes of memory, thus yielding 192 gigabytes of high-speed memory around the AI chip. Next time you buy an AI accelerator system, make sure it uses Micron’s HBM3E which uses 30% less power than the competitive products. However, unless you’re building an AI data center, you’re likely not in the market to buy one of these systems which cost between 25 to 40 thousand dollars and are on backorder for a few years. If you’re curious about high bandwidth memory, or Micron’s next generation of graphics memory take a look at one of these links in the description. Alternatively, if designing the next generation of memory chips interests you, Micron is always looking for talented scientists and engineers to help innovate on cutting edge chips and you can find out more about working for Micron using this link. Now that we’ve explored many of the physical components inside this graphics card and GPU, let’s next explore the computational architecture and see how applications like video game graphics and bitcoin mining run what’s called “embarrassingly� parallel operations. Although it may sound like a silly name, embarrassingly parallel is actually a technical classification of computer problems where little or no effort is needed to divide the problem into parallel tasks, and video game rendering and bitcoin mining easily fall into this category. Essentially, GPUs solve embarrassingly parallel problems using a principle called SIMD, which stands for single instruction multiple data where the same instructions or steps are repeated across thousands to millions of different numbers. Let’s see an example of how SIMD or single instruction multiple data is used to create this 3D video game environment. As you may know already, this cowboy hat on the table is composed of approximately 28 thousand triangles built by connecting together around 14,000 vertices, each with X, Y, and Z coordinates. These vertex coordinates are built using a coordinate system called model space with the origin of 0,0,0 being at the center of the hat.To build a 3D world we place hundreds of objects, each with their own model space into the world environment and, in order for the camera to be able to tell where each object is relative to other objects, we have to convert or transform all the vertices from each separate model space into the shared world coordinate system or world space. So, as an example, how do we convert the 14 thousand vertices of the cowboy hat from model space into world space? Well, we use a single instruction which adds the position of the origin of the hat in world space to the corresponding X,Y, and Z coordinate of a single vertex in model space. Next we copy this instruction to multiple data, which is all the remaining X,Y, and Z coordinates of the other thousands of vertices that are used to build the hat. Next, we do the same for the table and the rest of the hundreds of other objects in the scene, each time using the same instructions but with the different objects’ coordinates in world space, and each objects’ thousands of vertices in model space. As a result, all the vertices and triangles of all the objects are converted to a common world space coordinate system and the camera can now determine which objects are in front and which are behind. This example illustrates the power of SIMD or single instruction multiple data and how a single instruction is applied to 5,629 different objects with a total of 8.3 million vertices within the scene resulting in 25 million addition calculations. The key to SIMD and embarrassingly parallel programs is that every one of these millions of calculations has no dependency on any other calculation, and thus all these calculations can be distributed to the thousands of cores of the GPU and completed in parallel with one another. It's important to note that vertex transformation from model space to world space is just one of the first steps of a rather complicated video game graphics rendering pipeline and we have a separate video that delves deeper into each of these other steps. Also, we skipped over the transformations for the rotation and scale of each object, but factoring in these values is a similar process that requires additional SIMD calculations. Now that we have a simple understanding of SIMD, let’s discuss how this computational architecture matches up with the physical architecture. Essentially, each instruction is completed by a thread and this thread is matched to a single CUDA core. Threads are bundled into groups of 32 called warps, and the same sequence of instructions is issued to all the threads in a warp. Next warps are grouped into thread blocks which are handled by the streaming multiprocessor. And then finally thread blocks are grouped into grids, which are computed across the overall GPU. All these computations are managed or scheduled by the Gigathread Engine, which efficiently maps thread blocks to the available streaming multiprocessors. One important distinction is that within SIMD architecture, all 32 threads in a warp follow the same instructions and are in lockstep with each other, kind of like a phalanx of soldiers moving together. This lock step execution applied to GPUs up until around 2016. However, newer GPUs follow a SIMT architecture or single instruction multiple threads. The difference between SIMD and SIMT is that while both send the same set of instructions to each thread, with SIMT, the individual threads don’t need to be in lockstep with each other and can progress at different rates. In technical jargon, each thread is given its own program counter. Additionally, with SIMT all the threads within a streaming multiprocessor use a shared 128 kilobyte L1 cache and thus data that’s output by one thread can be subsequently used by a separate thread. This improvement from SIMD to SIMT allows for more flexibility when encountering warp divergence via data-dependent conditional branching and easier reconvergence for the threads to reach the barrier synchronization. Essentially newer architectures of GPUs are more flexible and efficient especially when encountering branches in code. One additional note is that although you may think that the term warp is derived from warp drives, it actually comes from weaving and specifically the Jacquard Loom. This loom from 1804 used programmable punch cards to select specific threads out of a set to weave together intricate patterns. As fascinating as looms are, let’s move on. The final topics we’ll explore are bitcoin mining, tensor cores and neural networks.

Additionally, we have a Patreon page with AMAs and behind the scenes footage, and, if you find what we do useful, we would appreciate any support. Thank you. So now that we’ve explored how single instruction multiple threads is used in video games, let’s briefly discuss why GPUs were initially used for mining bitcoin. We’re not going to get too far into the algorithm behind the blockchain and will save it for a separate episode, but essentially, to create a block on the blockchain, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is run on a set of data that includes transactions, a time stamp, additional data, and a random number called a nonce. After feeding these values through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm a random 256-bit value is output. You can kind of think of this algorithm as a lottery ticket generator where you can’t pick the lottery number, but based on the input data, the SHA-256 algorithm generates a random lottery ticket number. Therefore, if you change the nonce value and keep the rest of the transaction data the same, you’ll generate a new random lottery ticket number. The winner of this bitcoin mining lottery is the first randomly generated lottery number to have the first 80 bits all zeroes, while the rest of the 176 values don’t matter and once a winning bitcoin lottery ticket is found, the reward is 3 bitcoin and the lottery resets with a new set of transactions and input values. So, why were graphics cards used? Well, GPUs ran thousands of iterations of the SHA-256 algorithm with the same transactions, timestamp, other data, but, with different nonce values. As a result, a graphics card like this one could generate around 95 million SHA-256 hashes or 95 million randomly numbered lottery tickets every second, and hopefully one of those lottery numbers would have the first 80 digits as all zeros. However, nowadays computers filled with ASICs or application specific integrated circuits perform 250 trillion hashes a second or the equivalent of 2600 graphics cards, thereby making graphics cards look like a spoon when mining bitcoin next to an excavator that is an asic mining computer. Let’s next discuss the design of the tensor cores. It’ll take multiple full-length videos to cover generative AI, and neural networks, so we’ll focus on the exact matrix math that tensor cores solve. Essentially, tensor cores take three matrices and multiply the first two, add in the third and then output the result. Let’s look at one value of the output. This value is equal to the sum of values of the first row of the first matrix multiplied by the values from the first column of the second matrix, and then the corresponding value of the third matrix is added in. Because all the values of the 3 input matrices are ready at the same time, the tensor cores complete all of the matrix multiplication and addition calculations concurrently. Neural Networks and generative AI require trillions to quadrillions of matrix multiplication and addition operations and typically uses much larger matrices. Finally, there are Ray Tracing Cores which we explored in a separate video that’s already been released. That’s pretty much it for graphics cards.

languages breath of developer experience and needs and ongoing emerging algorithms and techniques to support our developer community and meet them where they are today we offer over 450 libraries many which are tailored to specific domains an Ever evolving developer landscape take python for example warp is our pythonic framework for building and accelerating data generation and spatial Computing most physics based simulators in HBC engage in some form of spatial Computing whether it in quantum chemistry climate modeling or fluid dynamics all of which operate in 3D space and by expressing these calculations and warp they can be automatically differentiated and integrated into AI workflows one of the most most popular python libraries that exist today is numpy numpy is the foundation library for mathematical Computing for python developers it's used by over 5 million scientific and Industrial developers with 300 million downloads just last month over 32,000 GitHub applications use numpy in important science domains like astronomy physics signal processing and many others however as scientists look to scale their applications to use large HPC clusters they often need to use lower level distributed computing libraries like open MPI but what if you didn't what if your numpy program could just automatically paralyze across a GPU cluster without having to rewrite the Python program into a different supercomputing application today we're announcing Cai numeric a dropin replacement for the numpy library with cpai numeric researchers can write in Python and easily scale

coust about their pioneering work on genomic epistasis and climate emulation but first let's turn to Dr Arvin ramanathan from argon National Laboratory to discuss their advancements in protein design one of the key tasks in protein design is to come up with novel proteins that have the same function but are different from what we have seen from over the course of 4 billion years of evolution experimental data happens to come at much slower Paces than what you would expect from a computational workflow like a simulation protein design is quite a happening area in AI right now it's undergoing this huge revolution in terms of how AI models are being deployed and developed this is one of the the first attempts at building something that's IM multimodal we actually have the descriptions that are provided in natural language and then you have the protein sequences that are represented and we basically use that to train a large language model that will enable us to interact with and get new designs and one of the key things that we also learned from this paper was the fact that yes it is possible for us to stand up this workflow not on just one platform but across several different platforms at the same time we happen to use almost all of nvidia's architecture from 00s all the way to Grace Hopper chips but one of the cool things that we observed was in terms of pre-training this model we could really achieve nearly three xof flops in mixed Precision runs on the system again this sort of runs at the scale of I think half of the system was what we actually used to achieve that sort of performance is really [Music] unbelievable one of the key benefits and motivations for accelerating workloads is to reduce energy consumption nowhere is this more understood than in supercomputing where the end of Mo's law was first predicted supercomputing centers like oish National Labs as far back as 2010 recognized that the energy for NextGen supercomputers built with CPUs will consume even more power than a major US city this truth also applies to Applications themselves even though an accelerated server May consume more power than a standard CPU system the significant reduction in time to solution results in a huge reduction in the total energy needed to compute a solution for example Texas Advanced Computing Center and Anis achieved a 110x speed up and 6X better Energy Efficiency on a 2.5 billion cell problem using Grace Hopper at enal h100 gpus improved Energy Efficiency by 4X for a wind farm simulation tsmc reduced energy use by 9x using kitho

infiniband for scientific simulations will be among the first to adopt the advanced Quantum x800 for developing cuttingedge trillion parameter models many customers want to use ethernet instead of infiniband to simplify their operations however standard ethernet was not built to meet the demands of ai ai factories alternate between GPU compute periods and Collective operation data transfers

standout example is evolutionary scales work in accelerating drug Discovery with the release of the esm3 generative model for protein design built on the Nvidia accelerated Computing platform platform esm3 was trained on over 2 billion protein sequences using 60 times more data and 25 times more computing power than its predecessor esm2 now let's hear from Dr David keys of cou to tell us about their two Gordon Bell finalist submissions for genomics and climate modeling genomewide Association studies explore the great dogma of biology that genotype leads to phenotype genotype here includes not only genomic factors but also environmental factors like demographics diet smoking habits and so forth and the goal is to start with a large database of individuals we used the 305,000 person UK biobank and uh then compare their genomes and their generalized genotypes to one another and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject we actually were able by means of scaling up to go from the 3 5,000 patients for which we have real data to a synthetic database generated from 13 million patients and that number is actually enough for more than half the countries of the world to do a full genomic analysis of their populations we had very little difficulty moving the code from one to another so in particular we ran on the v100s of summit we ran on the A1 100s of Leonardo and we ran on the hopper 100s the GH configuration of Alps node for node Hopper is by far the most interesting in terms of performance and also because it offers the fp8 and we're happy to use it as close to the low Precision end as we can get away with and would encourage other domain scientists to try to take advantage of that this is a very exciting prospect uh because many future venues of smart health and smart agriculture will benefit greatly from a democratized genomewide Association studies there is a 45 institution campaign in its sixth generation of generating future climates called seip and they are starting to become handicapped by the volume of data that they produce and each of these institutions is devoting hundreds of millions of core hours to generating these future climates climate emulation is a statistical model that tries to reproduce the statistics of the chaotic simulations we actually brought the queriable distance down to about 3 and 1/2 km from maybe 100 km on earlier models we were able to obtain 8 exif flops of mixed Precision on the Alps system and that was on 2,000 of those nodes I think a digital twin is reproducing the statistics of the real world by making the full 2D surface of the Earth visible at very high resolution with data compression uh with Statistics that reproduce ensembles of pte based models we feel that we've democratized climate [Music] emulation it is incredible to see all the great work being done by researchers to harness the power of AI for science while training AI models is important the real value relies in deploying these models and using them in inference where they can generate insights and predictions in real time to make it easier for users to scale AI models in production we've introduced Nvidia Nim inference microservices we've collaborated with the model Builders worldwide to convert their models into high performance efficient runtimes as Nims these Nims deliver two to five times faster token throughput than standard AI runtimes offering the best total cost of ownership weather and climate affect a wide range of Industries Transportation energy agriculture insurance and many more the frequency of extreme weather events costing over a billion dollars is increasing at an alarming rate since 1980 the financial impact of severe storm events in the US has increased 25 fold the importance of timely and accurate weather modeling data is at an all-time high the weather company uses Nvidia gpus for kilometer scale simulations of their graph model achieving 10 times higher throughput and 15 times greater Energy Efficiency compared to traditional CPU based simulations to drive even greater speed and efficiency they're also working with the video to adopt AI based methods to generate high resolution forecast data today we're announcing two new Nims for Earth 2 to empower climate Tech application providers with new AI capabilities nvidia's Earth 2 ciff is a generative AI model for kilometer scale super resolution earlier this year we showed its ability to Super resolve typhoons over Taiwan today Earth 2 Nim for cordi is now available cordi is 500 times faster and 10,000 times more energy efficient than traditional highresolution numerical weather prediction using CPUs we've also worked with us weather forecasting agencies to develop a ctive model for the entire continental US an area 300 times larger than the original Taiwan based model however not every use case requires high resolution forecasts some applications can benefit from more larger ensembles at corser resolutions state-of-the-art numerical models like the GFS are limited to 20 ensembles due to computational constraints today we're also announcing the availability of forecast net Nim it can deliver Global two-e forecasts 5,000 times faster than numerical weather models this makes it possible to use ensembles with thousands of members opening new opportunities for climate Tech providers now they can estimate risks related to extreme weather and predict low probability events that current competitional methods might miss there is a new Industrial Revolution happening in biofarma driven by a I AI models shorten the time to therapy and increase the success rate of new medicines the Nvidia biion Nemo framework lets scientists choose from various AI templates to build customized models bio is purpose built for Pharma applications and as a result delivers twice the training performance than other AI software are used today biion Nemo is accelerating computer AED drug Discovery in many of the world's pharmaceutical companies today we're announcing the Bemo framework is available as an open- Source repository on GitHub we're excited to see what AI can do for the future of the healthcare industry today we're also announcing diff do 2.0 an Invidia Nim microservice for predicting how drugs interact with Target proteins dioc 2.0 is six times faster than 1.0 published just one year ago one of the main drivers behind our performance boost is the new new cou equivariance library which speeds up essential mathematical operations for molecular predictions diff do has been retrained using the plender database the largest molecular protein structur database in the world which is boosting diff's accuracy this new version is built to unlock a new scale of virtual screening and Drug Discovery and we're excited to see what our ecosystem of researchers does with it next AI has transformed the study of proteins for drug Discovery and we think AI has the potential to make the same impact in digital chemistry with an estimated 10 to the 60th possible materials in the universe and only 10 to the eth currently known there's huge potential to innovate announcing Nvidia Alchemy it's a collection of chemistry specific Nims for the discovery of new compounds scientists start by defining the properties they want like strength conductivity low toxicity or even color a generative model suggests thousands to millions of potential candidates with the desired properties then the Alchemy Nim can sort the candidate compounds for stability by solving for their lowest energy states using Nvidia warp resulting in 100 times faster design space search going from months to a day using the Alchemy workflow the best candidates are identified before moving forward to costly real world testing traditional engineering analysis workflows from physics simulation to visualization can take weeks or even months to complete most analysis of physical systems like planes and Automobiles and ships use a set of loosely coupled applications each generating information which must be interpreted by engineers at each step a real-time digital twin enables an engineer to adjust design parameters for example you could change the shape of a body panel and see how it impacts streamlines in real time announcing Omniverse blueprint for realtime digital twins the blueprint is a reference workflow that includes nvidia's acceleration libraries physics AI Frameworks and Omniverse to design simulate and visualize all in real time it can run on all Cloud platforms as well as nvidia's own djx cloud Al Cadence seens and others are exploring how to integrate the blueprint into their own services and products for design acceleration Nvidia is also collaborating with fre scale to incorporate the blueprint into their physics AI platform let's take a look at the blueprint in action everything manufactured is first simulated with Advanced physics and solvers computational fluid dynamic simulations or cfd can take hours or months limiting the number of possible design Explorations with an Nvidia Omniverse blueprint for realtime physics digital twins software makers can integrate Nvidia acceleration libraries physics ML and RTX visualization into their existing tools enabling a 1200X speed up in design iteration time here luminary Cloud builds a fully real-time virtual wind tunnel based on the blueprint first luminary uses the Nvidia modulus physics ml framework to train a simulation AI model using data generated from their Nvidia Cuda X accelerated cfd solver the model understands the complex relationship between airflow fields and varying car geometries generating results orders of magnitude times faster than with the solver alone the AI output is visualized in real time using Omniverse apis now an engineer can make geometry or scene modifications seeing the effects in real time and because of omniverses data interoperability the engineer can even bring new new geometries and the simulation will adapt instantly what took weeks or even months is now a matter of seconds software developers everywhere can now bring unprecedented speed and flexibility to the world's industrial designers and Engineers helping save massive cost and shorten the time to Market ansus is adopting nvidia's Technologies into its CA platform Anis fluent accelerated by Nvidia gpus Insight powered by Omniverse visualization and Sim AI built on Nvidia Nim microservices AI will not only transform simulation it will accelerate scientific experimentation as well an overwhelming amount of data is being generated by Advanced instruments such as radio telescopes particle accelerators x-ray light sources and fusion reactor experiments for example the square kilometer array is expected to be completed by the end of the decade the ska in Australia will produce an average of 1 terabyte a second a thousand times more than the current state-of-the-art array in particle physics the lhcb detector at CERN produces 5 terabytes of data per second following the 2030 upgrade it could reach as high as 25 terabytes per second both the instruments and the researchers time are incredibly valuable making essential to extract meaningful insights from all of this data as efficiently as possible we are working with the researchers at the SEI Institute and breakthrough listen to deploy the world's first AI search for fast radio bursts or F frbs while over 1,000 have been detected only 15 have been traced to specific galaxies we've implemented a realtime pipeline using Nvidia Hollow scan at the Allen telescope array processing data from 28 dishes at 100 gbits per second this pipeline can process 100 times more data than conventional methods used today this is the first direct feed of raw telescope data to an AI model for f frb detection Quantum Hardware offers the opportunity to revolutionize Computing in fundamental ways unfortunately today's best quantum processors can only perform hundreds of operations before their fundamental unit of computation their cubits just become overwhelmed wood noise this makes scaling Quantum Hardware into useful Computing devices impractical today we're announcing a partnership with Google to apply nvidia's state-of-the-art AI supercomputing to solve this Challenge and accelerate their Quantum Hardware development to be useful quantum computers need large numbers of cubits operating with performance far beyond today's capabilities AI supercomputing is the key to building higher quality error corrected cubits that can meet these demands Google Quantum AI is working with Nvidia to explore how to accelerate digital representations of their superconducting cubits unlike circuit simulations which focus on the highle operation of an ideal quantum computer dynamical simulations model the complex physics describing real noisy Quantum Hardware fully accounting for how the cubits inside the quantum processor interact not only with each other but also with their surrounding environment dynamical simulations are essential to understanding and reducing Cubit specific sources of noise using Nvidia hardware and software Google Quantum aai researchers can accelerate these complex simulations this enhances the ability of researchers to understand the noise in their systems explore new designs and increase Hardware performance all of which are essential for scaling Quantum [Music] processors and we're also announcing that dynamical simulation is available in Cuda QQ our open- source Quantum development platform this means that through caq simulations capture the full dynamics of every Cubit comprehensively unlike commonly performed Quantum simulations these types of comprehensive Cubit simulations that would have previously taken a week now now can run in just minutes with caq developers of all Quantum processors can perform larger simulations and explore more scalable Cubit designs together nvidia's growing network of quantum partners are driving toward the goal of achieving practical large-scale Quantum Computing as we conclude this exciting journey through nvidia's latest Innovations we invite you to come to the Nvidia Booth to see many of these Technologies firsthand interact with James our are digital human and witness the future of AI driven virtual interactions experience the world's first realtime interactive Wind Tunnel built on Nvidia Omniverse blueprints explore the power of Earth 2 NIMS in climate modeling and see how hollow scan is revolutionizing Radio astronomy you'll also hear from researchers sharing breakthroughs in fields like energy storage and seismic simulation in our theater thank you and have a great super computing 2024 [Music] Jensen this is such an honor thank you for being here I'm delighted to be here thank you in honor of your return to Stanford I decided we'd start talking about the time when you first left you joined LSI logic and that was one of the most exciting companies at the time you're building a phenomenal reputation with some of the biggest names in Tech and yet you decide to leave to become a Founder what motivated you uh uh Chris and Curtis Chris and Curtis uh uh I was an engineer at LS logic and Chris and Curtis were at Sun and I was working with with uh some of the brightest Minds in computer science at the time of all time uh including andyto shim and others uh building building workstations and Graphics workstations and so on so forth and uh Chris and Curtis uh uh said one day that they like to leave some son and they like uh me to go figure out what they're going to go leave four and and um I had a great job but they they insisted that I uh figure out you know with them how to how to build a company and so so we hung out at Denny when whenever they Dro by and and uh uh which was which is by the way my alma marter my my first company uh you know my first job before for before CEO was a was a dishwasher and so and and I did that very well and and so anyways uh we got together and and we we DEC and it was during the the microprocessor Revolution this is 1993 and and 1992 when we were getting together the PC Revolution was just getting going you you know that Windows 95 obviously which is the Revolutionary version of Windows uh didn't even come to the market yet and Pentium wasn't even announced yet and so and this is this is all before the right before the PC Revolution and it was it was pretty clear that that uh the microprocessor was going to be very important and we we thought you know why don't we build a company uh to go solve problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose Computing can't and and so that that became the company's Mission uh to go to go build a computer uh the type of computers and solve problems that normal computers can't and to this day uh we're focusing on that and if you look at all the the problems that that um and the markets that we opened up as a result uh it's you know things like uh computational drug design um uh weather simulation materials design these are all things that we're really really proud of uh robotics uh self-driving cars uh autonomous autonomous uh software we call artificial intelligence and then all you know of course uh we uh we drove the the uh U the techn techology so hard that that eventually the computational cost uh uh went to approximately zero and then enabled enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself artificial intelligence as we know it today and so so I that was that was it that was the journey yeah thank you all for [Laughter] coming well these applications are on all of our minds today but back then the CEO of LSI logic convinced his biggest investor Don Valentine to meet with you he is obviously the founder of seoa yeah now I can see a lot of Founders here edging forward in anticipation but how did you convince the most sought-after investor in Silicon Valley to invest in a team of firsttime Founders building a new product for a market that doesn't even exist I I didn't know how to write a business plan and and uh uh so I went to a went to a book bookstore and back then there were bookstores and and and um in the business book section there was this book and it was written by somebody I knew Gordon Bell and this book I should go find it again but it's a very large book and the book says how to write a business plan and and that was you know a highly specific title for a very niche market and it seems like he wrote it for like you know 14 people and I was one of them and and so I I bought the book I I should have known right away that that it was a bad idea because that you know Gordon is super super smart and super smart people have a lot to say and and they wanted you know and I I'm pretty sure Gordon wants to teach me how to write a business plan uh completely and so I I picked up this book it's like 450 pages long well I never got through it not even close I I flipped through it a few pages and I go you know what by the time I'm done reading this this thing I'll be out of business I'll be out of money and and uh Lori and I only had about 6 months uh in the bank and we had already Spencer Madison and and uh and a dog and so the five of us had to live off of you know uh whatever money we had in the bank and and so I didn't have much time uh and so instead of writing the business plan uh I just went to talk to to W Coran he turn he called me one day and said hey you know you left the company you didn't even tell me what you were doing I want you to come back and explain it to me and so I went back and I explained it to Wi and wi wi at the end of it he he said I have no idea what you said and and um that's one of the worst elevator pitches I've ever heard um and then he picked up the phone and he called Don Valentine and he he called Don and he says Don I want you to give I'm going to send a kid over I want you to give him money he's one of the best employees l logic ever ever had and um I and and so the thing I learned is is uh uh you you can make up a great interview you could even have a bad interview but you can't run away from your past and so have a good past you know try to have a good past and and and in a lot of ways I was serious when I said I was a good dishwasher I was probably Denny's best dishwasher um I I planned my work I was organized you know I was Misan plus and then I washed The Living Daylights out of the dishes and then and then you know they promoted me to bus I was certain I'm the best bus boy Denny's ever had you know I was I never left a station with empty-handed I never came back empty-handed I was very efficient and then they and so anyways eventually I became you know a CEO I'm working I'm still working on being being a good CEO but you talk about being the bad you needed to be the best among 89 other companies that were funded after you to build the same thing and then with 6 to9 months of Runway left you realized that the initial Vision was just not going to work MH how did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you well we started uh this company called for Accelerated Computing and the question is what is it for what's the killer app and and uh that was that that came our first great decision um and this is what sequa funded the first great decision was the first killer app was going to be 3D graphics and the the the technology was going to be 3D graphics and the application was going to be video games at the Time 3D Graphics was impossible to make cheap it was Million dooll image generators from Silicon graphics and the video and so it was a million dollars and and it's hard to make cheap um and the video game Market was0 billion doar so you have this incredible technology that's hard to uh commoditize and commercialize and then you have this Market that doesn't exist that was that intersection was the founding of our company and and I still remember uh when when Don at the end of my presentation uh you know Don was still kind of he he said you know know one of the things he said to me which made a lot of sense back then makes a lot of sense today he says startups don't invest in startups or startups don't partner with startups and his point is that in order for NVIDIA to succeed we needed another startup to succeed and that other startup was Electronic Arts and and then on the way out he he reminded me that electronic arts's CTO is 14 years old and had to be driven to work by his mom and he just wanted to remind me that that's who I'm relying on that that and then and uh and then after that he said if you lose my money I'll kill you and that that was that was kind of my memories of that first meeting uh but nonetheless uh we created we created something uh we went on uh the next several years to go create the market to create the gaming market for PCs and it took a long time to do so we're still doing it today uh we realize that not only do you have to create the technology and uh invent a new way of doing computer Graphics so that what was a million dollars is now you know three 400 $500 um that fits in the computer and you have to go create this new market so we have to create technology create markets the idea that a company would create technology create markets defines Nvidia today almost everything we do we create technology we create markets that's that's the reason why people say we have a you know people call it a stack an ecosystem words like that um but that's basically it at the core for 30 years what Nvidia realized we had to do is in order to uh create the conditions by which somebody could buy our products we had to go invent this new market and uh it's the reason why we were early in autonomous driving it was the reason why we're early in deep learning it was the reason why we're early and just about all these things including uh computational drug disc drug design and and Discovery um all these different areas we're trying to create the market while we're creating the technology and so that that's um uh okay and then we got we got going and and then and then um Microsoft introduced uh a standard called direct 3D and that spawned off hundreds of companies and we found ourselves a couple years later competing with just about everybody and and the thing that that we invented the company the technology we invented uh 3D graphics with the consumerized 3D with turns out to be incompatible with direct 3D so we started this company we had this 3D Graphics thing we million-dollar thing we're trying to make it consumerized and so we invented all this technology and then shortly after it became incompatible and um uh so we had to reset the company uh or go out of business but we didn't know how to we didn't know how to build it the way that Microsoft had defined it and um and I remember I remember a meeting at at you know on a weekend and the conversation was you know we now have 89 competitors uh I understand that the way we do it is not not right but we don't know how to do it the right way and and um thankfully there was another bookstore and um and the bookstore is called fries Fries electronics I don't think I don't know if it's still here um and so I had I had I had um I I I think I drove madis and my daughter on a weekend to fries and and it was sitting right there the openg manual uh which would defined uh how silicon Graphics did computer graphics and so it was it was right there it was like $68 a book and so I had a couple hundred dollar I bought three books I took it back to the office and I said guys I found it our future and I handed out I had three versions of it handed out had a big nice centerfold you know the centerfold is the opengl pipeline which is the computer Graphics Pipeline and um uh and I handed it to uh the same Geniuses that I founded the company with and we implemented the openg pipeline like nobody had ever implemented the opengl pipeline and we built something the world never seen and so uh a lot of lessons are right there that moment in time for our company uh gave us so much confidence and the reason for that is you can succeed in doing something inventing a future even if you were not informed about it at all and is kind of the my attitude about everything now you know when somebody tells me about something and I've never heard of it before or if I've heard of it never don't understand how it works at all my first thought is always you know how hard can it be and it's probably just a textbook away you know you're probably one archive paper away from figuring this out and so I spent a lot of time reading archive papers and um and it it's true it's true you can you can um now of course you can't learn how somebody else does something and do it exactly the same way and hope to have a different outcome but you could learn how something can be done and then go back to First principles and ask yourself um giving the conditions today given my motivation given the instruments the tools um given you know how things have changed how would I redo this how would I reinvent this whole thing how would I design a how would I build a car today would I build it incrementally from 1950s and 1900s how would I build a computer today how would I write software today does that make sense and so I go back to First principles all the time uh even in the company today and just reset ourselves you know because the world has changed and U the way we wrote software in the past was monolithic and it's designed for supercomputers but now it's disaggregated it's you know so on so forth and how we think about software today how we think about computers today how we think just always cause your company always cause yourself to go back to first first principles and it creates lots and lots of opportunities yeah the way you applied this technology turns to be revolutionary you get all the momentum that you need to IPO and then some more because you grow your Revenue nine times in the next four years but in the middle of all of this success you decide to Pivot a little bit the focus of innovation happening at Nvidia based on a phone call you have with this chemistry professor can you tell us about that phone call and how you connected the dots from what you heard to where you went uh remember at the core the company was uh pioneering a new way of doing Computing computer Graphics was the first application uh but we already always knew that there would be other applications and so image processing came particle physics came fluids came so on so forth all kinds of interesting things that we wanted to do uh we made the processor more programmable so that we could express more algorithms if you will and then one day we invented um uh programable shaders which made all forms of Imaging and computer Graphics programmable that was a great breakthrough so we invented Ed that on top of that we invented uh we we tried to look for ways to express um uh more comp more sophisticated algorithms uh that could be computation that could be computed on our processor which is very different than a CPU and so we we created this thing called CG this I think it was 2003 or so C for gpus it predated Cuda by about three years um the same person who wrote The textbook that saved the company Mark Hilgard wrote that textbook and um I and so CG was was super cool we wrote textbooks about it we started teaching people how to use it we developed tools and such um and then several several researchers discovered it uh many of the researchers here students here at Stanford was using it um many of the the engineers that that then became uh engineers at Nvidia were were uh playing with it uh uh a doctor a couple of doctors at at Mass General picked it up and used it for uh CT reconstruction so I flew out and saw them and said you know what are you guys doing with this thing and uh they told me about that and then and then uh a um uh a computational a Quantum chemist uh used it to um uh Express his his algorithms and so I I realized that that there's there's some evidence that people might want to use this uh and and it gave it gave us gave us you know incrementally more more confidence that that we ought to go do this that that this field this form of computing could solve problems that normal computers really can't and and um reinforced our belief and and kept us going every time you heard something new you really savored that surprise and that seems to be a theme throughout your leadership at Nvidia U it feels like you make the these bets so far in advance of Technology inflections that when the Apple finally falls from the tree you're standing right there in your black leather jacket waiting to catch it how do you find the conv always seems like a diving catch oh it does seem like a diving catch you do things based on core beliefs you know we we uh we we deeply believe that that we uh we could create a computer that solves problems Norm processing can't do that there are limits to what a CPU can do there are limits to what general purpose Computing can do and then there are interesting problems uh that we can go solve the question the question is always are those in interesting problems only or are they can they also be interesting markets because if they're not interesting markets it's not sustainable and Nvidia went through about a decade where we were investing in this future and the markets didn't exist there was only One Market at the time was computer Graphics uh for 10 15 years the markets that fuels Nvidia today just didn't exist and so so how do you continue um uh with all of the people around you you know our company and you know nvidia's management team and all of the amazing Engineers that they're creating this future with me um all of your shareholders your board of directors all your partners you're you're taking everybody with you and there's no evidence uh of a market that is really really challenging you know the fact that the technology can solve problems and the fact that you have research papers that that are used that that are made possible because of it are interesting but you're always looking for that market but nonetheless before a market exists you still need early indicators of future success you know we we have this phrase in the company is is you know there's a phrase called key performance indicators unfortunately kpis are hard to understand I find kpis hard to understand what's a good kpi you know a lot of people you know when when we look for kpis we go gross margins that's not a kpi that's a result you know you're looking for something that's an early indicators of future positive results okay and as early as possible and the reason for that is because you want early indic that early sign that you're going in the right direction and so we have this phrase is called EO ifs FS you know early indicators e FS early indicators of future success and and um and it helps people uh uh because I was using it all the time to give the company hope that hey look we solved this problem we solved that problem we solved this problem the markets didn't exist but there were important problems and that's what the company's about to solve these problems uh we want to be sustainable and therefore the markets have to exist at some point but you you want you want to decouple the result from um uh from evidence that you're doing the right thing okay and so so so that's how you that's how you kind of solve this problem of investing into something that's very very far away um and having the the conviction uh to stay on the road is to find as early as possible the indicators that you're doing the right things and so uh start with a core belief unless something you know changes your mind you continue to believe in it and um look for early indicators of future success what are some of those early indicators that have been used by product teams at Nvidia uh all kinds um uh uh I saw I saw I saw a uh a paper uh long before I saw the paper I met some people that needed my help on on um uh on this thing called Deep learning at a time I didn't even know what deep learning Le was and um and they needed us to create a domain specific language so that um all of their algorithms could be expressed easily on our on our processors and we created this thing called cdnn and it's essentially the SQL um uh SQL is in in storage Computing this is um neuron network computing and uh we created a a language if you will domain specific language for that you know kind of like the openg GL of of uh deep learning and so we we uh they needed us to do that so that they they could express their mathematics and uh they didn't understand Cuda but they understood their deep learning and so we created this thing in the middle for them uh and the reason why we did it was because uh even though there were zero I mean this you know these researchers had no money uh and and this is kind of one of the the great skills of our company that that you're willing to do something even though the financial returns are complet completely non-existent or maybe very very far out even if you believed in it uh we we ask ourselves you know is this worthy work to do um does this Advance a field of science somewhere that matters notice this is something that I I've been talking about you know since the very beginning of time uh we ex we we find inspiration uh not from the size of a market from but from the importance of the work uh because the importance of the work is the early indicators of a future Market and nobody has to write a nobody has to do a a um a business case on it nobody has to show me a a pnl uh nobody has to show me a financial forecast the only question is is this important work and if we didn't do it uh would it happen without us now if we didn't do something and something could happen without us it gives me tremendous Joy actually and the reason for that is could you imagine the world got better you didn't have to lift a finger that's the definition of you know of of uh ultimate laziness and and and in a lot of ways in a lot of ways you want that habit and the reason for that is this uh you want the company to be lazy about doing things that other people always do can do if somebody else can do it let them do it we should go select the things that if we didn't do it the world the world would fall apart you have to convince yourself of that that if I don't do this it won't get done that is Inc and and if that work is hard and that work is impactful and important then it gives you a sense of purpose does that make sense and so our company has been selecting these projects deep learning was just one of them and the first indicator of of the success of that was this you know fuzzy cat that that Andrew an came up with and um then Alex kvki uh detected cats um you know not all the time but you know successfully enough that it was you know this might take us somewhere and then we reasoned about the structure of deep learning and you know we're computer scientists and we understand how things work and and so we we uh we convinced ourselves this could change everything and and um and anyhow that but that's an that's an example so these selections that you've made they've paid huge dividends both literally and figuratively um but you've had to steer the company through some very challenging times like when it lost 80% of its market cap amid the financial crisis cuz what Wall Street didn't believe in your bet on ML um in times like these how do you steer the company and keep the employees motivated at the task at hand uh it's this is the my reaction during that time is the same reaction I had about this week uh earlier today you asked me about this week my pulse was exactly the same this week is no different than last week or the week before that um and so the opposite of that you know when you drop it 80% um it don't get me wrong when when your share price drops 80% it's a little embarrassing okay and and um you just want to you just want to wear a t-shirt that says wasn't my fault um but even more than that you just you just don't want to you you don't want to get out of your bed you don't want to leave the house um all of that is true all of that is true um but then you go back to go back to just doing your job I woke up at the same time I prioritize my day in the same way uh I go back to what do I believe uh you got to gut check always gut check back to the court you know what do you believe uh what are the most important things uh and uh just check them off you know sometimes sometimes it's helpful to you know family loves me okay check um you know double you know right and so you just got to check it off and and you go back to your core um and then go back to work and and then every conversations go back to the core uh keep the company focused back on the core do you believe in it did something change the stock price changed but did something else change the physics change the gravity change did did all of the things that that that we assumed uh that we believed that led to our decision did any of those things change because if those things change you got to change everything but if none of those things change you change nothing you keep on going yeah yeah that's how you do it in speaking with your employees they say that you try to avoid the public in speaking with your employees they've said that your leadership including the employees I'm just kidding no le lead leaders have to be seen unfortunately that's the hard that's the hard part you know I I I was I was I was at I was I was an electrical engineering student and I was quite Young when I went to school um when I went to went to College I was I was still 16 years old and so I was I was young when I did everything and and so I was a bit of an introvert kind of you know I'm shy I don't enjoy public speaking I'm delighted to be here I'm not suggesting um but but it's it's not something that I do naturally and and um I and so so when when things are challenging um uh it's not easy to be in front of precisely the people that you care most about you know and the reason for that is because could you imagine a company meeting we just our stock prices dropped by 80% and the most important thing I have to do as the CEO is this to come and face you explain it and partly you're not sure why partly you're not sure how long uh how bad yeah you just don't know these things and and but you still got to explain it face face all these people and you know what they're thinking you know you you know some of them are probably thinking we're doomed uh some people are probably thinking you're an idiot and some people are probably thinking you know something else and so I um there are a lot of things that people are thinking and you know that they're thinking those things but you still have to get in front of them and and and deal you know do the hard work they may be thinking of those things but yet not a single person of your leadership team left during times like this and in fact unemployable that's what I keep reminding them I'm just kidding I'm surrounded by Geniuses I'm surrounded by Geniuses yeah other Geniuses un un unbelievable uh Nvidia is well known to have singularly the best management team on the planet this is the deepest technology management team the world's ever seen I'm surrounded by a whole bunch of them and they're just genius business teams marketing teams sales teams just incredible and engineering teams my research teams unbelievable yeah your employees say that your leadership style is very engaged you have 50 direct reports you encourage people across all parts of the organization to send you the top five things on their mind and you constantly remind people that no task is beneath you can you tell us why you've purposefully designed such a flat organization and how should we be thinking about our organizations that we designed in the future uh no task is is to me no task is beneath me because remember I used to be a dishwasher and I and I mean that I used to clean toilets I mean you know I cleaned a lot of toilets I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined and and some of them just can't [Laughter] unsee I don't know I I don't know what to tell you you know that's life and and so so uh uh you can't show me and you can't show me a task that is that's beneath me um now I'm not doing it I'm not doing it uh only because because of uh you know whether it's beneath me or not beneath me U if you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you and in my in my review of IT share with you how I reason through it uh I've made a contribution to you I've made I've made it possible for you to see how I reason through something and and by reasoning as you know how someone reasons through something empowers you you go oh my gosh that's how you reason through something like this it's not as complicated as it seems this is how you reason through something that's super ambiguous this is how you reason through something that's incalculable this is how you reason through something that you know seems to be very scary this is how you seem do you understand and so I show people how to reason through things all the time strategy things you know how to forecast something how to break a problem down uh and you're just you're empowering people all over the place and so that's how I see it if you send me something you want me to help review it uh I'll do my best and I'll show you how I would do it um I in the process of doing that of course I learned a lot from you is that right you gave me a seat of a lot of information I learned a lot and so I I feel rewarded by the process um it does take a lot of energy sometimes because you know you got in order to add value to somebody and they're incredibly smart as a starting point and I'm surrounded by incredibly smart people you have to at least get to their plane you know you have to get into their head space and that's really hard that's really hard um and that takes just an enormous amount of emotional and intellectual energy and so I feel exhausted after after I I work on things like that um I'm surrounded by by a lot of great people a CEO should have the most direct report rep s um uh by definition because the people that reports to the CEO requires the least amount of management it makes no sense to me that CEOs have so few people reporting to them except for one fact that I know to be true the the knowledge the information of a CEO is supposedly so so valuable so secretive you can only share with two other people or three and their information is so invaluable so incredibly secretive that they can only share with a couple more well um I don't believe in in in a culture an environment where the information that you possess is the reason why you have power I would like us all to to to contribute to the company and our position in the company should have something to do with our ability to reason through complicated things lead other people to um achieve greatness um Inspire Empower other people um support other people those are the reasons why the the management team exists in service of all of the other people that work in the company to create the conditions by which all of the all of these amazing people who volunteer to come work for you instead of all the other amazing high-tech companies around the world they elected they volunteer to work for you and so you should create the conditions by which they could do their life's work which is Mission you know you probably heard it i' I've said that you know pretty clearly and I and I believe that what my job is is very simply to create the conditions by which you could do your life's work and so how do I do that what does that condition look like well that condition should um result in great deal of empowerment you should you can only be empowered if you understand the circumstance isn't it right you have to understand the cont you have to understand the context of the situation you're in in order for you to come up with great ideas and so I have to create a circumstance where you understand the context which means you have to be informed and the best way to be informed is for there to be as little layers of information mutilation right between us and so that's the reason why it's very often that I'm reasoning through things like in an audience like this I say first of all this is the beginning facts these are the data that we have um this is how I would reason through it these are some of the assumptions these are some of the unknowns these are some of the knowns and so you reason through it and now you've created an organization that's highly empowered nvidia's 30,000 people we're the smallest large company in the world we're tiny little company but every employee is so empowered and they're making smart decisions on my behalf every single day and the reason for that is because you know they understand that they understand my condition they understand my condition I'm very transparent with people um and uh and I believe that that I can trust you with the information often times the information is hard to hear and uh the the situations are complicated uh but I trust that you can handle it you're you know a lot of people hear me say you know these you're adults here you can handle this sometimes they're not really adults they just graduated I'm just kidding I know that when I first graduated was barely an adult and um I but I was I was fortunate that I was trusted with with uh with uh important information so I want to do that I want to create the conditions for people to do that I do want to now address the topic that is on everybody's mind AI last week you said that generative Ai and accelerated Computing have hit the Tipping Point so as this technology becomes more mainstream what are the applications that you personally are most excited about well you have to go back to First principles and ask yourself what is generative AI what happened um what happened was we have a we now have the ability to have software that can understand something they they can understand why you know what is first of all we digitized everything that was you know like for example Gene sequencing you digitized genes but what does it mean that sequence of genes what does it mean we've digitized amino acids um but what does it mean uh and so we now have the ability we dig digitize words we digitize sounds uh we digitize images and videos we digitize a lot of things but what does it mean we now have the ability through um a lot of study a lot of Da data and from their patterns and relationships we We Now understand what they mean not only do we understand what they mean we we can translate between them because we learned about the meaning of these things in the same world we didn't learn about them separately so we we learned about speech and and words and and paragraphs and vocabulary in the same context and so we found correlations between them and they're all you know registered if you will registered to each other and so now we uh not only do we understand uh the modality the meaning of each modality we can understand how to translate between them and so uh for obvious things you could caption video to text that's captioning uh text to uh images M Journey uh text to text chat GPT I amazing things and so so we now we now know that uh we understand meaning and we can translate uh the translation of something is generation of information and and um uh and all of a sudden you you have to take your you take a step back and ask yourself um uh what is the implication in every single layer of everything that we do and so I'm exercising in front of you I'm reasoning in front of you uh the same thing I did a quarter uh 15 years ago when I first saw um uh alexnet some 13 14 years ago I guess um I how I reasoned through it uh what did I see how interesting what can it do very cool but then most importantly what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean to every single layer of computing because you know we're in the world of computing and so what it means is that that the way that we um process information fundamentally will be different in the future that's what Nvidia builds you know chips and system the way we write software will be fundamentally different in the future the type of software we'll be able to write write in the future will be different new applications and then ALS also the processing of those applications will be different what was historically a retrieval based model where uh in uh information was pre pre-recorded if you will almost you know we wrote the text pre-recorded and we retrieved it based on uh some recommender system algorithm in the future uh some seed of information will be will be uh the starting point we call them prompts you as you guys know and then we generate the rest of it and so the future of computing will be highly generated well let me give you an example of what's happening for example uh we're having a conversation right now very little of the information I'm trans I'm conveying to you is Retreat most of it is generated it's called intelligence and so in the future we're going to have a lot more generative our computers will will perform in that way it's going to be highly generative instead of Highly retrieval based you go back and you got to ask yourself you know now for for you know entrepreneurs you got to ask yourself uh what industries will be disrupted therefore will we think about networking the same way will we think about storage the same way will we think about would we be as abusive of internet traffic as we are today probably not notice we're having a conversation right now and and I to get in my car every every question so we don't have to be as abusive of of transformation information transporting as we used to um uh what's going to be more what's going to be less uh what kind of applications you know etc etc so you can go through the entire industrial spread and ask yourself what's going to get disrupted what's going to get be different what's going to get NED you know so on so forth and and that reasoning starts from what is happening what is generative AI Foundation Al what is happening go back to First principles with all things there was something I was going to tell you about organization you asked the question and I forgot to answer it the way you create an organization by the way someday um don't worry about how other companies or charts look you start from first principles remember what an organization is designed to do the organizations of the past where there's a king you know CE and then then you have all all these you know the Royal subjects you know the Royal Court and then eaff and then you keep working your way down eventually they're employees well the reason why it was designed that way is because they they wanted the employees to have as low information as possible because their fundamental purpose of the soldiers is to die in the field of battle to die without asking questions you guys know this I don't I only have 30,000 employees I would like them none of them to die I would like them to question everything does that make sense and so the way you organize in the past and the way you organize today is very different to Second the question is what is nid what does Nvidia build an organization is designed so that we could build what it whatever it is we build better and so if we all build different things why why are we organized the same way why would why would this organizational Machinery be exactly the same irrespective of what you build it doesn't make make any sense you build computers you organize this way you build healthare Services you build exactly the same way it makes no sense whatsoever and so you had to go back to First principles just ask yourself what kind of Machinery what what is the input what is the output what are the properties of this environment you know what what is the what is the what is the forest that this animal has to live in what is this characteristics is it stable most of the time you're trying to squeeze out the last drop of water or is it changing all the time being attacked by everybody and so you got to understand you know you're the CEO your job is to architect this company that's my first job to create the conditions by which you can do your life's work and the architecture has to be right and so you have to go back to First principles and think about those things and I was fortunate that that when I was 29 years old you know I had the benefit of of of taking a step back and asking myself you know how would I build this company for the future and what would it look like and you know what's the operating system which is called culture what do we what kind of behavior do we en encourage enhance and what what do we discourage and not enhance you know so on so forth and anyways I want to save time for audience questions but um this year's theme for view from the top is redefining tomorrow and one question we've asked all of our guests is Jensen as the co-founder and CEO of Nvidia if you were to close your eyes and magically change one thing about tomorrow what would it be were we supposed to think about this in advance I I'm going to give you a horrible answer um I I don't know that it's one thing look there are a lot of things we don't control you know there are a lot of things we don't control um your job is to make a unique contribution live a life of purpose to do something that nobody else in the world would do or can do to make a unique contribution so that in the event that after you done um everybody says you know the world was better because you were here and so I think that that to me um I live I live my life kind of like this I go forward in time and I Look Backwards so you asked me a question that's exactly from a from a computer vision pose perspective exactly the opposite of how I think I never look forward from where I am I go forward in time and look backwards and the reason for that is it's easier I would look backwards and kind of read my history we did this and we did that way and we broke that prom down does that make sense and so it's a little bit like um how you guys solve problems you figure figure out what is the end result that you're looking for and you work backwards to achieve it and so I imagine Nvidia uh making a unique contribution to advancing the the future of of uh of computing which is the single most important instrument of all Humanity now it's not about our self self-importance but this is just what we're good at and it's incredibly hard to do and we believe we can make an absolute unique contribution it's taken US 31 years to be here and we're still just beginning our journey and so this is insanely hard to do and uh uh When I Look Backwards I believe that we made I believe that that we're going to be remembered as a company that kind of changed everything not because we went out and changed everything through all the things that we said but because we did this one thing that was insanely hard to do that we're incredibly good at doing that we loved doing we did for a long time I'm part of the GSP lead I graduated in 2023 so my question is how do you see see your company in the next decade as what challenges do you see your company would face and how you are positioned for that first of all can I just tell you what was going on through my head as you say what challenges the list that flew by my head was so so large uh that that I was trying to figure out what to select um now the honest truth is is that when you ask that question most of the challenges that showed up for me were technical challenges and the reason for that is because that was my morning if you were to you know chosen yesterday um it might have been Market creation challenges there are some markets that I gosh I just desperately would love to create I just can't we just do it already you know but we can't do it alone Nvidia is a technology platform company we're here in service of a whole bunch of other the companies so that they could realize if you will our hopes and dreams through them and and so some of the things that I would love I would love for the world of biology to to be at a point where it's kind of like the world of Chip design 40 years ago computer AED and design um Eda that entire industry really made possible for us today and I believe we're going to make possible for them tomorrow computer AED drug design because we're able to now represent genes and proteins and even cells now very very close to be able to represent and understand the meaning of a cell a combination of a whole bunch of genes um what is a cell mean it's kind of like what does that paragraph mean well if we could understand a a cell like we can understand a paragraph imagine what we could do and so uh so so I'm I'm anxious for that to happen you know I'm kind of excited about that uh there's some that I'm just excited about that I know we around the corner on for example uh humanoid robotics very very close around the corner and the reason for that is because if you can tokenize and understand speech why can't you tokenize and understand uh manipulation and so so these kind of computer science techniques you once you figure something out you ask yourself well if got do that why can't I do that and so I'm excited about those kind of things um and so that challenge is kind of a happy challenge uh some of the some of the other challenges some of the other challenges of course are industrial and geopolitical and they're social and and but you've heard all that stuff before these are all true you know the social issues in in the world uh the geopolitical issues in the world uh why can't we just get along uh things in the world why do I have to say those kind of things in the world um why do we have to say those things and then amplify them in the world uh why do we have to judge people so much in the world uh you you know all those things you guys all know that I don't have to say those things over again my name is Jose I'm a class of the 2023 uh from the GSB my question is uh are you worried at all about the pace at which we're developing AI um and do you believe that any sort of Regulation might be needed thank you uh yeah that's uh the answer is yes and no um we need uh you you know that the the the greatest breakthrough in uh modern AI of course deep learning and it enabled great progress but another incredible breakthrough is something that that humans know and we practice all the time uh and we just invented it for uh for language models called uh grounding reinforcement learning human feedback um I provide reinforcement learning human feedback every day that's my job um and their for their parents in the room uh you're providing reinforcement learning human feedback all the time okay now we just figured out how to do that um at a system systematic level for artificial intelligence there are a whole bunch of other technology necessary to uh guardrail uh fine-tune ground for example how do I generate um how do I generate uh uh uh tokens that obey the laws of physics you know right now things are floating in space and doing things and they don't they don't obey the laws of physics um how do that requires technology Guard railing requires technology fine-tuning requires technology alignment requires technology safety requires technology the reason why planes are so safe is because you know all of the autopilot systems are are surrounded by diversity and redundancy and all kinds of different functional safety and active safety systems that were invented I need all of that to be invented much much faster uh you also know that that the border between security and artificial intelligence cyber security and artificial intelligence is going to become blurry and blurry we need technology to advance very very quickly in the area of cyber security in in order to protect us from artificial intelligence and so so in a lot of ways we need technology to go faster a lot faster okay uh regulation there's two types of Regulation uh there's social regulation I don't know what to do about that but there's product and services regulation know exactly what to do about that okay so um the fa the FAA the FDA the uh Nitsa you name it all the the fs and all the NS and all the you know fcc's the they all have regulations for products and services that are have particular use cases uh um uh bar exams and doctors and you know so on so forth um you all have uh qual qualification exams you all have standards that you have to reach you all have to uh continuously be certified uh accountants and so on so forth whether it's a product or a service there are lots and lots of regulations please do not add a super regulation that cuts across of it the regulator who is regulating accounting should not be the regulator that regulates a doctor you know I love accountants um but I I just you know if I ever need an open heart surgery the fact that they can close books is interesting but not sufficient and so and so I I would like I would like um all of those all of those fields that already have products and services um to also enhance their regulation in context of in the context of AI okay but I left out this one very big one which is this the social implication of AI and how do you how do you deal with that I don't have great answers for that um but you know enough people are talking about it but it's important to subdivide all of this into chunks does that make sense so that we don't we don't become super hyperfocused on this one thing at the expense of a whole bunch of routine things that we could have done and as a result people are getting killed by cars and planes and you know it doesn't make any sense we should make sure that we we do the right things there okay very practical things may I take one more question well we have some rapid fire questions for you as view from the tradition okay I was trying to avoid that okay all right far away far away well your first job was at Denny's they now have a booth dedicated to you what was your fondest memory of working my second job was AMD by the way is there Booth dedicated to me there I'm just kidding um I'm I love my job there I did I love there it's a great company yeah yeah um if there were a worldwide shortage of black leather jackets what would we be see you wearing oh no I've I've got a large reservoir of black jackets I'm the I'll be the only person who is who is not concerned um you spoke a lot about textbooks if you had to write one what would it be called I wouldn't write one you're asking me a hypothetical question that has no possibility of of of uh that's fair and finally if you could share one parting piece of advice to broadcast across Stanford what would it be uh it's not a word but but um I you know have a core belief um gut check it every day I pursue it with all your might pursue it for a very long time surround yourself with people you love and take them on that right so that's the story of Nvidia Jensen this last hour has been a treat thank you for spending thank you very much [Music] than I am I am a Visionary Illuminating galaxies to witness the birth of stars and sharpening our understanding of extreme weather events I am a helper guiding the blind through a crowded world I was thinking about running to the store and giving voice to those who cannot speak to not make me laugh I am a Transformer harnessing gravity to store Renewable Power and Paving the way towards unlimited clean energy for us all I am a trainer teaching robots to assist to watch out for danger and help save lives I am a Healer providing a new generation of cures and new levels of patient care doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications definitely these antibiotics don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them I am a navigator generating virtual scenarios to let us safely explore the real world and understand every decision I even helped write the script breathe life into the words I am AI brought to life by Nvidia deep learning and Brilliant Minds everywhere please welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Wong welcome to GTC I hope you realize this is not a concert you have arrived at a developers conference there will be a lot of science described algorithms computer architecture mathematics I sensed a very heavy weight in the room all of a sudden almost like you were in the wrong place no no conference in the world is there a great assembly of researchers from such diverse fields of science from climatech to radio Sciences trying to figure out how to use AI to robotically control MOS for Next Generation 6G radios robotic self-driving car s even artificial intelligence even artificial intelligence everybody's first I noticed a sense of relief there all of all of a sudden also this conference is represented by some amazing companies this list this is not the attendees these are the presentors and what's amazing is this if you take away all of my friends close friends Michael Dell is sitting right there in the IT industry all of the friends I grew up with in the industry if you take away that list this is what's amazing these are the presenters of the non it Industries using accelerated Computing to solve problems that normal computers can't it's represented in life sciences healthc Care genomics Transportation of course retail Logistics manufacturing industrial the gamut of Industries represented is truly amazing and you're not here to attend only you're here to present to talk about your research $100 trillion dollar of the world's Industries is represented in this room today this is absolutely amazing there is absolutely something happening there is something going on the industry is being transformed not just ours because the computer industry the computer is the single most important instrument of society today fundamental transformations in Computing affects every industry but how did we start how did we get here I made a little cartoon for you literally I drew this in one page this is nvidia's Journey started in 1993 this might be the rest of the talk 1993 this is our journey we were founded in 1993 there are several important events that happen along the way I'll just highlight a few in 2006 Cuda which has turned out to have been a revolutionary Computing model we thought it was revolutionary then it was going to be an overnight success and almost 20 years later it happened we saw it coming two decades later in 2012 alexnet Ai and Cuda made first Contact in 2016 recognizing the importance of this Computing model we invented a brand new type of computer we called the dgx one 170 Tera flops in this supercomputer eight gpus connected together for the very first time I hand delivered the very first dgx-1 to a startup located in San Francisco called open AI dgx-1 was the world's first AI supercomputer remember 170 Tera flops 2017 the Transformer arrived 2022 chat GPT capture the world's imag imaginations have people realize the importance and the capabilities of artificial intelligence and 2023 generative AI emerged and a new industry begins why why is a new industry because the software never existed before we are now producing software using computers to write software producing software that never existed before it is a brand new category it took share from nothing it's a brand new category and the way you produce the software is unlike anything we've ever done before in data centers generating tokens producing floating Point numbers at very large scale as if in the beginning of this last Industrial Revolution when people realized that you would set up factories apply energy to it and this invisible valuable thing called electricity came out AC generators and 100 years later 200 years later we are now creating new types of electrons tokens using infrastructure we call factories AI factories to generate this new incredibly valuable thing called artificial intelligence a new industry has emerged well well we're going to talk about many things about this new industry we're going to talk about how we're going to do Computing next we're going to talk about the type of software that you build because of this new industry the new software how you would think about this new software what about applications in this new industry and then maybe what's next and how can we start preparing today for what is about to come next well but before I start I want to show you the soul of Nvidia the soul of our company at the intersection of computer Graphics physics and artificial intelligence all intersecting inside a computer in Omniverse in a virtual world simulation everything we're going to show you today literally everything we're going to show you today is a simulation not animation it's only beautiful because it's physics the world is beautiful it's only amazing because it's being animated with robotics it's being animated with artificial intelligence what you're about to see all day it's completely generated completely simulated and Omniverse and all of it what you're about to enjoy is the world's first concert where everything is homemade everything is homemade you're about to watch some home videos so sit back and enjoy yourself m what a God I love it Nvidia accelerated Computing has reached the Tipping Point general purpose Computing has run out of steam we need another way of doing Computing so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing so that we can continue to consume more and more Computing while being sustainable accelerated Computing is a dramatic speed up over general purpose Computing and in every single industry we engage and I'll show you many the impact is dramatic but in no industry is a more important than our own the industry of using simulation tools to create products in this industry it is not about driving down the cost of computing it's about driving up the scale of computing we would like to be able to sim at the entire product that we do completely in full Fidelity completely digitally in essentially what we call digital twins we would like to design it build it simulate it operate it completely digitally in order to do that we need to accelerate an entire industry and today I would like to announce that we have some Partners who are joining us in this journey to accelerate their entire ecosystem so that we can bring the world into accelerated Computing but there's a bonus when you become accelerated your infrastructure is cou to gpus and when that happens it's exactly the same infrastructure for generative Ai and so I'm just delighted to announce several very important Partnerships there are some of the most important companies in the world and Anis does engineering simulation for what the world makes we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the ancis ecosystem to connect anus to the Omniverse digital twin incredible the thing that's really great is that the install base of media GPU accelerated systems are all over the world in every cloud in every system all over Enterprises and so the app the applications they accelerate will have a giant installed base to go serve end users will have amazing applications and of course system makers and csps will have great customer demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally first software partner they were there in very first day of our company synopsis revolutionized the chip industry with high level design we are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're accelerating computational lithography one of the most important applications that nobody's ever known about in order to make chips we have to push lithography to limit Nvidia has created a library domain specific library that accelerates computational lithography incredibly once we can accelerate and software Define all of tsmc who is announcing today that they're going to go into production with Nvidia kitho once this software defined and accelerated the next step is to apply generative AI to the future of semiconductor manufacturing push in Geometry even further Cadence builds the world's essential Eda and SDA tools we also use Cadence between these three companies ansis synopsis and Cadence we basically build Nvidia together we are cud accelerating Cadence they're also building a supercomputer out of Nvidia gpus so that their customers could do fluid Dynamic simulation at a 100 a thousand times scale basically a wind tunnel in real time Cadence Millennium a supercomputer with Nvidia gpus inside a software company building supercomputers I love seeing that building Cadence co-pilots together imagine a day when Cadence could synopsis ansis tool providers would offer you AI co-pilots so that we have thousands and thousands of co-pilot assistants helping us design chips Design Systems and we're also going to connect Cadence digital twin platform to Omniverse as you could see the trend here we're accelerating the world's CAE Eda and SDA so that we could create our future in digital Twins and we're going to connect them all to Omniverse the fundamental operating system for future digital twins one of the industries that benefited tremendously from scale and you know you all know this one very well large language model basically after the Transformer was invented we were able to scale large language models at incredible rates effectively doubling every six months now how is it possible that by doubling every six months that we have grown the industry we have grown the computational requirements so far and the reason for that is quite simply this if you double the size of the model you double the size of your brain you need twice as much information to go fill it and so every time you double your parameter count you also have to appropriately increase your training token count the combination of those two numbers becomes the computation scale you have to support the latest the state-of-the-art open AI model is approximately 1.8 trillion parameters 1.8 trillion parameters required several trillion tokens to go train so so a few trillion parameters on the order of a few trillion tokens on the order of when you multiply the two of them together approximately 30 40 50 billion quadrillion floating Point operations per second now we just have to do some Co math right now just hang hang with me so you have 30 billion quadrillion a quadrillion is like a paa and so if you had a PA flop GPU you would need 30 billion seconds to go compute to go train that model 30 billion seconds is approximately 1,000 years well 1,000 years it's worth it like to do it sooner but it's worth it which is usually my answer when most people tell me hey how long how long's it going to take to do something 20 years how it it's worth it but can we do it next week and so 1,000 years 1,000 years so what we need what we need are bigger gpus we need much much bigger gpus we recognized this early on and we realized that the answer is to put a whole bunch of gpus together and of course innovate a whole bunch of things along the way like inventing 10 censor cores advancing MV links so that we could create essentially virtually Giant gpus and connecting them all together with amazing networks from a company called melanox infiniband so that we could create these giant systems and so djx1 was our first version but it wasn't the last we built we built supercomputers all the way all along the way in 2021 we had Seline 4500 gpus or so and then in 2023 we built one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world it's just come online EOS and as we're building these things we're trying to help the world build these things and in order to help the world build these things we got to build them first we build the chips the systems the networking all of the software necessary to do this you should see these systems imagine writing a piece of software that runs across the entire system Distributing the computation across thousands of gpus but inside are thousands of smaller gpus millions of gpus to distribute work across all of that and to balance the workload so that you can get the most Energy Efficiency the best computation time keep your cost down and so those those fundamental Innovations is what got us here and here we are as we see the miracle of chat GPT emerg in front of us we also realize we have a long ways to go we need even larger models we're going to train it with multimodality data not just text on the internet but we're going to we're going to train it on texts and images and graphs and charts and just as we learn watching TV and so there's going to be a whole bunch of watching video so that these Mo models can be grounded in physics understands that an arm doesn't go through a wall and so these models would have common sense by watching a lot of the world's video combined with a lot of the world's languages it'll use things like synthetic data generation just as you and I do when we try to learn we might use our imagination to simulate how it's going to end up just as I did when I Was preparing for this keynote I was simulating it all along the way I hope it's going to turn out as well as I had it in my head as I was simulating how this keynote was going to turn out somebody did say that another performer did her performance completely on a treadmill so that she could be in shape to deliver it with full energy I I didn't do that if I get a l wind at about 10 minutes into this you know what happened and so so where were we we're sitting here using synthetic data generation we're going to use reinforcement learning we're going to practice it in our mind we're going to have ai working with AI training each other just like student teacher Debaters all of that is going to increase the size of our model it's going to increase the amount of the amount of data that we have and we're going to have to build even bigger gpus Hopper is fantastic but we need bigger gpus and so ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to a very very big GPU named after David Blackwell math ician game theorists probability we thought it was a perfect per per perfect name black wealth ladies and gentlemen enjoy this the com Blackwell is not a chip Blackwell is the name of a platform uh people think we make gpus and and we do but gpus don't look the way they used to here here's the here's the here's the the if you will the heart of the blackw system and this inside the company is not called Blackwell it's just the number and um uh this this is Blackwell sitting next to oh this is the most advanced GPU in the world in production today this is Hopper this is Hopper Hopper changed the world this is Blackwell it's okay Hopper you're you're very good good good boy well good girl 208 billion transistors and so so you could see you I can see that there's a small line between two dyes this is the first time two dieses have abutted like this together in such a way that the two chip the two dieses think it's one chip there's 10 terabytes of data between it 10 terabytes per second so that these two these two sides of the Blackwell Chip have no clue which side they're on there's no memory locality issues no cach issues it's just one giant chip and so uh when we were told that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond the limits of physics uh the engineer said so what and so this is what what happened and so this is the Blackwell chip and it goes into two types of systems the first one is form fit function compatible to Hopper and so you slide all Hopper and you push in Blackwell that's the reason why one of the challenges of ramping is going to be so efficient there are installations of Hoppers all over the world and they could be they could be you know the same infrastructure same design the power the electricity The Thermals the software identical push it right back and so this is a hopper version for the current hgx configuration and this is what the other the second Hopper looks like this now this is a prototype board and um Janine could I just borrow ladies and gentlemen Jan Paul and so this this is the this is a fully functioning board and I just be careful here this right here is I don't know10 billion the second one's five it gets cheaper after that so any customers in the audience it's okay all right but this is this one's quite expensive this is to bring up board and um and the the way it's going to go to production is like this one here okay and so you're going to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected to a Grace CPU the grace CPU has a super fast chipto chip link what's amazing is this computer is the first of its kind where this much computation first of all fits into this small of a place second it's memory coherent they feel like they're just one big happy family working on one application together and so everything is coherent within it um the just the amount of you know you saw the numbers there's a lot of terabytes this and terabytes that's um but this is this is a miracle this is a this let's see what are some of the things on here uh there's um uh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on on uh your which one is mine and your left one of them it doesn't matter uh one of them one of them is a CPU chipto chip link is my left or your depending on which side I was just I was trying to sort that out and I just kind of doesn't matter hopefully it comes plugged in so okay so this is the grace Blackwell system but there's more so it turns out it turns out all of the specs is fantastic but we need a whole lot of new features uh in order to push the limits Beyond if you will the limits of physics we would like to always get a lot more X factors and so one of the things that we did was We Invented another Transformer engine another Transformer engine the second generation it has the ability to dynamically and automatically rescale and recas numerical formats to a lower Precision whenever it can remember artificial intelligence is about probability and so you kind of have you know 1.7 approximately 1.7 time approximately 1.4 to be approximately something else does that make sense and so so the the ability for the mathematics to retain the Precision and the range necessary in that particular stage of the pipeline super important and so this is it's not just about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU it's not quite the world's not quite that simple you've got to figure out when you can use that across a computation that is thousands of gpus it's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you want to make sure that the the uh uh the training job is going going to converge and so this new Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV link it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very importantly it has computation in the network and the reason for that is because when you have so many different gpus working together we have to share our information with each other we have to synchronize and update each other and every so often we have to reduce the partial products and then rebroadcast out the partial products the sum of the partial products back to everybody else and so there's a lot of what is called all reduce and all to all and all gather it's all part of this area of synchronization and collectives so that we can have gpus working with each other having extraordinarily fast links and being able to do mathematics right in the network allows us to essentially amplify even further so even though it's 1.8 terabytes per second it's effectively higher than that and so it's many times that of Hopper the likel Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on in is approximately zero and the reason for that is because there's so many components working at the same time the statistic the probability of them working continuously is very low and so we need to make sure that whenever there is a well we checkpoint and restart as often as we can but if we have the ability to detect a weak chip or a weak note early we could retire it and maybe swap in another processor that ability to keep the utilization of the supercomputer High especially when you just spent $2 billion building it is super important and so we put in a Ras engine a reliability engine that does 100% self test in system test of every single gate every single bit of memory on the Blackwell chip and all the memory that's connected to it it's almost as if we shipped with every single chip its own Advanced tester that we CH test our chips with this is the first time we're doing this super excited about it secure AI only this conference do they clap for Ras the the uh secure AI uh obviously you've just spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating a very important Ai and the the code the intelligence of that AI is encoded in the parameters you want to make sure that on the one hand you don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get contaminated and so we now have the ability to encrypt data of course at rest but also in transit and while it's being computed it's all encrypted and so we now have the ability to encrypt and transmission and when we're Computing it it is in a trusted trusted environment trusted uh engine environment and the last thing is decompression moving data in and out of these nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really essential and so we've put in a high linee speed compression engine and effectively moves data 20 times times faster in and out of these computers these computers are are so powerful and there's such a large investment the last thing we want to do is have them be idle and so all of these capabilities are intended to keep Blackwell fed and as busy as possible overall compared to Hopper it is two and a half times two and a half times the fp8 performance for training per chip it is ALS it also has this new format called fp6 so that even though the computation speed is the same the bandwidth that's Amplified because of the memory the amount of parameters you can store in the memory is now Amplified fp4 effectively doubles the throughput this is vitally important for inference one of the things that that um is becoming very clear is that whenever you use a computer with AI on the other side when you're chatting with the chatbot when you're asking it to uh review or make an image remember in the back is a GPU generating tokens some people call it inference but it's more appropriately generation the way that Computing is done in the past was retrieval you would grab your phone you would touch something um some signals go off basically an email goes off to some storage somewhere there's pre-recorded content somebody wrote a story or somebody made an image or somebody recorded a video that record pre-recorded content is then streamed back to the phone and recomposed in a way based on a recommender system to present the information to you you know that in the future the vast majority of that content will not be retrieved and the reason for that is because that was pre-recorded by somebody who doesn't understand the context which is the reason why we have to retrieve so much content if you can be working with an AI that understands the context who you are for what reason you're fetching this information and produces the information for you just the way you like it the amount of energy we save the amount of networking bandwidth we save the amount of waste of time we save will be tremendous the future is generative which is the reason why we call it generative AI which is the reason why this is a brand new industry the way we compute is fundamentally different we created a processor for the generative AI era and one of the most important parts of it is content token generation we call it this format is fp4 well that's a lot of computation 5x the Gen token generation 5x the inference capability of Hopper seems like enough but why stop there the answer is it's not enough and I'm going to show you why I'm going to show you why and so we would like to have a bigger GPU even bigger than this one and so we decided to scale it and notice but first let me just tell you how we've scaled over the course of the last eight years we've increased computation by 1,000 times8 years 1,000 times remember back in the good old days of Moore's Law it was 2x well 5x every what 10 10x every 5 years that's easier easiest math 10x every 5 years a 100 times every 10 years 100 times every 10 years at the in the middle in the hey days of the PC Revolution one 100 times every 10 years in the last 8 years we've gone 1,000 times we have two more years to go and so that puts it in perspective the rate at which we're advancing Computing is insane and it's still not fast enough so we built another chip this chip is just an incredible chip we call it the Envy link switch it's 50 billion transistors it's almost the size of Hopper all by itself this switch ship has four MV links in it each 1.8 terabytes per second and and it has computation in as I mentioned what is this chip for if we were to build such a chip we can have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at full speed at the same time that's insane it doesn't even make sense but if you could do that if you can find a way to do that and build a system to do that that's cost effective that's cost effective how incredible would it be that we could have all these gpus connect over a coherent link so that they effectively are one giant GPU well one of one of the Great Inventions in order to make a cost effective is that this chip has to drive copper directly the seres of this chip is is just a phenomenal invention so that we could do direct drive to copper and as a result you can build a system that looks like this now this system this system is kind of insane this is one dgx this is what a dgx looks like now remember just six years ago it was pretty heavy but I was able to lift it I delivered the uh the uh first djx1 to open Ai and and the researchers there it's on you know the pictures are on the internet and uh uh and we all autographed it uh and um uh if you come to my office it's autographed there is really beautiful and but but you could lift it uh this dgx this dgx that djx by the way was 170 teraflops if you're not familiar with the numbering system that's 0.17 pedop flops so this is 720 the first one I delivered to open AI was 0.17 you could round it up to 0.2 won't make any difference but and back then was like wow you know 30 more teraflops and so this is now 720 pedop flops almost an exal flop for training and the world's first one exal flops machine in one rack just so you know there are only a couple two three exop flops machines on the planet as we speak and so this is an exop flops AI system in one single rack well let's take a look at the back of it so this is what makes it possible that's the back that's the that's the back the dgx MV link spine 130 terabytes per second goes through the back of that chassis that is more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet so we we could basically send everything to everybody within a second and so so we we have 5,000 cables 5,000 mvlink cables in total 2 miles now this is the amazing thing if we had to use Optics we would have had to use transceivers and retim and those transceivers and reers alone would have cost 20,000 watts 2 kilowatts of just transceivers alone just to drive the mvlink spine as a result we did it completely for free over mvlink switch and we were able to save the 20 kilow for computation this entire rack is 120 kilowatts so that 20 kilowatts makes a huge difference it's liquid cooled what goes in is 25° C about room temperature what comes out is 45°c about your jacuzzi so room temperature goes in jacuzzi comes out 2 liters per second we could we could sell a peripheral 600,000 Parts somebody used to say you know you guys make gpus and we do but this is what a GPU looks like to me when somebody says GPU I see this two years ago when I saw a GPU was the hgx it was 70 lb 35,000 Parts our gpus now are 600,000 parts and 3,000 lb 3,000 lb 3,000 lb that's kind of like the weight of a you know Carbon Fiber Ferrari I don't know if that's useful metric but everybody's going I feel it I feel it I get it I get that now that you mention that I feel it I don't know what's 3,000 lb okay so 3,000 lb ton and a half so it's not quite an elephant so this is what a dgx looks like now let's see what it looks like in operation okay let's imagine what is what how do we put this to work and what does that mean well if you were to train a GPT model 1.8 trillion parameter model it took it took about apparently about you know 3 to 5 months or so uh with 25,000 amp uh if we were to do it with hopper it would probably take something like 8,000 gpus and it would consume 15 megawatts 8,000 gpus on 15 megawatts it would take 90 days about 3 months and that would allows you to train something that is you know this groundbreaking AI model and this is obviously not as expensive as as um as anybody would think but it's 8,000 8,000 gpus it's still a lot of money and so 8,000 gpus 15 megawatts if you were to use Blackwell to do this it would only take 2,000 gpus 2,000 gpus same 90 days but this is the amazing part only 4 me GS of power so from 15 yeah that's right and that's and that's our goal our goal is to continuously drive down the cost and the energy they're directly proportional to each other cost and energy associated with the Computing so that we can continue to expand and scale up the computation that we have to do to train the Next Generation models well this is training inference or generation is vitally important going forward you know probably some half of the time that Nvidia gpus are in the cloud these days it's being used for token generation you know they're either doing co-pilot this or chat you know chat GPT that or um all these different models that are being used when you're interacting with it or generating IM generating images or generating videos generating proteins generating chemicals there's a bunch of gener generation going on all of that is B in the category of computing we call inference but inference is extremely hard for large language models because these large language models have several properties one they're very large and so it doesn't fit on one GPU this is Imagine imagine Excel doesn't fit on one GPU you know and imagine some application you're running on a daily basis doesn't run doesn't fit on one computer like a video game doesn't fit on one computer and most in fact do and many times in the past in hyperscale Computing many applic applications for many people fit on the same computer and now all of a sudden this one inference application where you're interacting with this chatbot that chatbot requires a supercomputer in the back to run it and that's the future the future is generative with these chatbots and these chatbots are trillions of tokens trillions of parameters and they have to generate tokens at interactive rates now what does that mean well uh three to tokens is about a word I you know the the uh you know space the final frontier these are the adventures that's like that's like 80 tokens okay I don't know if that's useful to you and so you know the art of communications is is selecting good an good analogies yeah this is this is not going well every I don't know what he's talking about never seen Star Trek and so and so so here we are we're trying to generate these tokens when you're interacting with it you're hoping that the tokens come back to you as quickly as possible and as quickly as you can read it and so the ability for Generation tokens is really important you have to paralyze the work of this model across many many gpus so that you could achieve several things one on the one hand you would like throughput because that throughput reduces the cost the overall cost per token of uh generating so your throughput dictates the cost of of uh delivering the service on the other hand you have another interactive rate which is another tokens per second where it's about per user and that has everything to do with quality of service and so these two things um uh compete against each other and we have to find a way to distribute work across all of these different gpus and paralyze it in a way that allows us to achieve both and it turns out the search search space is enormous you know I told you there's going to be math involved and everybody's going oh dear I heard some gasp just now when I put up that slide you know so so this this right here the the y axis is tokens per second data center throughput the x- axis is tokens per second interactivity of the person and notice the upper right is the best you want interactivity to be very High number of tokens per second per user you want the tokens per second of per data center to be very high the upper upper right is is terrific however it's very hard to do that and in order for us to search for the best answer across every single one of those intersections XY coordinates okay so you just look at every single XY coordinate all those blue dots came from some repartitioning of the software some optimizing solution has to go and figure out what whether to use use tensor parallel expert parallel pipeline parallel or data parallel and distribute this enormous model across all these G different gpus and sustain performance that you need this exploration space would be impossible if not for the programmability of nvidia's gpus and so we could because of Cuda because we have such Rich ecosystem we could explore this universe and find that green roof line it turns out that green roof line notice you got tp2 EPA dp4 it means two parall two uh tensor parallel tensor parallel across two gpus expert parallels across eight data parallel across four notice on the other end you got tensor parallel cross 4 and expert parallel across 16 the configuration the distribution of that software it's a different different um runtime that would produce these different results and you have to go discover that roof line well that's just one model and this is just one configuration of a computer imagine all of the models being created around the world and all the different different um uh configurations of of uh systems that are going to be available so now that you understand the basics let's take a look at inference of Blackwell compared to Hopper and this is this is the extraordinary thing in one generation because we created a system that's designed for trillion parameter gener generative AI the inference capability of Blackwell is off the charts and in fact it is some 30 times Hopper y for large language models for large language models like Chad GPT and others like it the blue line is Hopper I gave you imagine we didn't change the architecture of Hopper we just made it a bigger chip we just used the latest you know greatest uh 10 terab you know terabytes per second we connected the two chips together we got this giant 208 billion parameter chip how would we have performed if nothing else changed and it turns out quite wonderfully quite wonderfully and that's the purple line but not as great as it could be and and that's where the fp4 tensor core the new Transformer engine and very importantly the MV link switch and the reason for that is because all these gpus have to share the results partial products whenever they do all to all all all gather whenever they communicate with each other that mvlink switch is communicating almost 10 times faster than what we could do in the past using the fastest networks Okay so Blackwell is going to be just an amazing system for a generative Ai and in the future in the future data centers are going to be thought of as I mentioned earlier as an AI Factory an AI Factory's goal in life is to generate revenues generate in this case intelligence in this facility not generating electricity as in AC generator but of the last Industrial Revolution and this Industrial Revolution the generation of intelligence and so this ability is super super important the excitement of Blackwell is really off the charts you know when we first when we first um uh you know this this is a year and a half ago two years ago I guess two years ago when we first started to to go to market with hopper you know we had the benefit of of uh two two uh two csps uh joined us in a lunch and and we were you know delighted um and so we had two customers uh we have more now unbelievable excitement for Blackwell unbelievable excitement and there's a whole bunch of different configurations of course I showed you the configurations that slide into the hopper form factor so that's easy to upgrade I showed you examples that are liquid cooled that are the extreme versions of it one entire rack that's that's uh connected by mvlink 72 uh we're going to Blackwell is going to be ramping to the world's AI companies of which there are so many now doing amazing work in different modalities the csps every CSP is geared up all the OEM and odms Regional clouds Sovereign AIS and Telos all over the world are signing up to launch with Blackwell this Blackwell Blackwell would be the the the most successful product launch in our history and so I can't wait wait to see that um I want to thank I want to thank some partners that that are joining us in this uh AWS is gearing up for Blackwell they're uh they're going to build the first uh GPU with secure AI they're uh building out a 222 exf flops system you know just now when we animated uh just now the digital twin if you saw the the all of those clusters are coming down by the way that is not just art that is a digital twin of what we're building that's how big it's going to be besides infrastructure we're doing a lot of things together with AWS we're Cuda accelerating stag maker AI we're Cuda accelerating Bedrock AI uh Amazon robotics is working with us uh using Nvidia Omniverse and Isaac Sim AWS Health has Nvidia Health Integrated into it so AWS has has really leaned into accelerated Computing uh Google is gearing up for Blackwell gcp already has A1 100s h100s t4s l4s a whole Fleet of Nvidia Cuda gpus and they recently announced the Gemma model that runs across all of it uh we're work working to optimize uh and accelerate every aspect of gcp we're accelerating data proc which for data processing their data processing engine Jax xlaa vertex Ai and mojoko for robotics so we're working with uh Google and gcp across a whole bunch of initiatives uh Oracle is gearing up for black wellth Oracle is a great partner of ours for Nvidia dgx cloud and we're also working together to accelerate something that's really important to a lot of companies Oracle database Microsoft is accelerating and Microsoft is gearing up for Blackwell Microsoft Nvidia has a wide- ranging partnership we're accelerating Cuda accelerating all kinds of services when you when you chat obviously and uh AI services that are in Microsoft Azure uh it's very very likely Nvidia is in the back uh doing the inference and the token generation uh we built they built the largest Nvidia infiniband supercomputer basically a digital twin of hours or a physical twin of hours uh we're bringing the Nvidia ecosystem to Azure Nvidia djx cloud to Azure uh Nvidia Omniverse is now hosted in Azure Nvidia Healthcare is an Azure and all of it is deeply integrated and deeply connected with Microsoft fabric the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell this is what I'm about to show you most of the most of the the the uh uh uh scenes that you've seen so far of Blackwell are the are the full Fidelity design of Blackwell everything in our company has a digital twin and in fact this digital twin idea is it is really spreading and it it helps it helps companies build very complicated things perfectly the first time and what could be more exciting than creating a digital twin to build a computer that was built in a digital twin and so let me show you what wistron is doing to meet the demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing widraw one of our leading manufacturing Partners is building digital twins of Nvidia dgx and hgx factories using custom software developed with Omniverse sdks and apis for their newest Factory wraw started with a digital twin to virtually integrate their multi-ad and process simulation data into a unified view testing and optimizing layouts in this physically accurate digital environment increased worker efficency icy by 51% during construction the Omniverse digital twin was used to verify that the physical build matched the digital plans identifying any discrepancies early has helped avoid costly change orders and the results have been impressive using a digital twin helped bring wion's Factory online in half the time just 2 and 1/2 months instead of five in operation the Omniverse digital twin helps widraw rapidly Test new layouts to accommodate new processes or improve operations in the existing space and monitor real-time operations using live iot data from every machine on the production line which ultimately enabled wion to reduce End to-end Cycle Times by 50% and defect rates by 40% with Nvidia Ai and Omniverse nvidia's Global ecosystem of partners are building a new era of accelerated AI enabled digitalization that's how we that's the way it's going to be in the future we're going to manufacturing everything digitally first and then we'll manufacture it physically people ask me how did it start what got you guys so excited what was it that you saw that caused you to put it all in on this incredible idea and it's this hang on a second guys that was going to be such a moment that's what happens when you don't rehearse this as you know was first Contact 20 12 alexnet you put a cat into this computer and it comes out and it says cat and we said oh my God this is going to change everything you take 1 million numbers you take one Million numbers across three channels RGB these numbers make no sense to anybody you put it into this software and it compress it dimensionally reduce it it reduces it from a million dimensions a million Dimensions it turns it into three letters one vector one number and it's generalized you could have the cat be different cats and and you could have it be the front of the cat and the back of the cat and you look at this thing you say unbelievable you mean any cats yeah any cat and it was able to recognize all these cats and we realized how it did it systematically structurally it's scalable how big can you make it well how big do you want to make it and so we imagine that this is a completely new way of writing software and now today as you know you could have you type in the word c a and what comes out is a cat it went the other way am I right unbelievable how is it possible that's right how is it possible you took three letters and you generated a million pixels from it and it made sense well that's the miracle and here we are just literally 10 years later 10 years later where we recognize textt we recognize images we recognize videos and sounds and images not only do we recognize them we understand their meaning we understand the meaning of the text that's the reason why it can chat with you it can summarize for you it understands the text it understood not just recognizes the the English it understood the English it doesn't just recognize the pixels and understood the pixels and you can you can even condition it between two modalities you can have language condition image and generate all kinds of interesting things well if you can understand these things what else can you understand that you've digitized the reason why we started with text and you know images is because we digitized those but what else have we digitized well it turns out we digitized a lot of things proteins and genes and brain waves anything you can digitize so long as there's structure we can probably learn some patterns from it and if we can learn the patterns from it we can understand its meaning if we can understand its meaning we might be able to generate it as well and so therefore the generative AI Revolution is here well what else can we generate what else can we learn well one of the things that we would love to learn we would love to learn is we would love to learn climate we would love to learn extreme weather we would love to learn uh what how we can predict future weather at Regional scales at sufficiently high resolution such that we can keep people out of Harm's Way before harm comes extreme weather cost the world $150 billion surely more than that and it's not evenly distributed $150 billion is concentrated in some parts of the world and of course to some people of the world we need to adapt and we need to know what's coming and so we are creating Earth too a digital twin of the Earth for predicting weather we and we've made an extraordinary invention called Civ the ability to use generative AI to predict weather at extremely high resolution let's take a look as the earth's climate changes AI powered weather forecasting is allowing us to more accurately predict and track severe storms like super typhoon chanthu which caused widespread damage in Taiwan and the surrounding region in 2021 current AI forecast models can accurately predict the track of storms but they are limited to 25 km resolution which can miss important details Invidia cordi is a revolutionary new generative AI model trained on high resolution radar assimilated Warf weather forecasts and air 5 reanalysis data using cordi extreme events like chanthu can be super resolved from 25 km to 2 km resolution with 1,000 times the speed and 3,000 times the Energy Efficiency of conventional weather models by combining the speed and accuracy of nvidia's weather forecasting model forecast net and generative AI models like cordi we can explore hundreds or even thousands of kilometer scale Regional weather forecasts to provide a clear picture of the best worst and most likely impacts of a storm this wealth of information can help minimize loss of life and property damage today cordi is optimized for Taiwan but soon generative super sampling will be available as part of the in viia Earth 2 inference service for many regions across the globe the weather company has the trust a source of global weather predictions we are working together to accelerate their weather simulation first principled base of simulation however they're also going to integrate Earth to cordi so that they could help businesses and countries do Regional high resolution weather prediction and so if you have some weather prediction you'd like to know like to do uh reach out to the weather company really exciting really exciting work Nvidia Healthcare something we started 15 years ago we're super super excited about this this is an area where we're very very proud whether it's Medical Imaging or genene sequencing or computational chemistry it is very likely that Nvidia is the computation behind it we've done so much work in this area today we're announcing that we're going to do something really really cool imagine all of these AI models that are being used to generate images and audio but instead of images and audio because it understood images and audio all the digitization that we've done for genes and proteins and amino acids that digitalization capability is now now passed through machine learning so that we understand the language of Life the ability to understand the language of Life of course we saw the first evidence of it with alphafold this is really quite an extraordinary thing after Decades of painstaking work the world had only digitized and reconstructed using cor electron microscopy or Crystal XR x-ray crystallography um these different techniques painstaking reconstructed the protein 200,000 of them in just what is it less than a year or so Alpha fold has reconstructed 200 million proteins basically every protein every of every living thing that's ever been sequenced this is completely revolutionary well those models are incredibly hard to use um for incredibly hard for people to build and so what we're going to do is we're going to build them we're going to build them for uh the the researchers around the world and it won't be the only one there'll be many other models that we create and so let me show you what we're going to do with it virtual screening for new medicines is a computationally intractable problem existing techniques can only scan billions of compounds and require days on thousands of standard compute nodes to identify new drug candidates Nvidia biion Nemo Nims enable a new generative screening Paradigm using Nims for protein structure prediction with Alpha fold molecule generation with MIM and docking with diff dock we can now generate and Screen candidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM can connect to custom applications to steer the generative process iteratively optimizing for desired properties these applications can be defined with biion Nemo microservices or built from scratch here a physics based simulation optimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to a Target protein while optimizing for other favorable molecular properties in parallel MIM generates high quality drug-like molecules that bind to the Target and are synthesizable translating to a higher probability of developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with Nims providing OnDemand microservices that can be combined to build powerful drug Discovery workflows like denovo protein design or ided molecule generation for virtual screening bio Nims are helping researchers and developers reinvent computational drug design Nvidia M MIM MIM cord diff there's a whole bunch of other models whole bunch of other models computer vision models robotics models and even of course some really really terrific open source language models these models are groundbreaking however it's hard for companies to use how would you use it how would you bring it into your company and integrate it into your workflow how would you package it up and run it remember earlier I just said that inference is an extraordinary computation problem how would you do the optimization for each and every one of these models and put together the Computing stack necessary to run that supercomputer so that you can run the models in your company and so we have a great idea we're going to invent a new way invent a new way for you to receive and operate software this software comes basically in a digital box we call it a container and we call it the Nvidia inference micr service a Nim and let me explain to you what it is a Nim it's a pre-trained model so it's pretty clever and it is packaged and optimized to run across nvidia's install base which is very very large what's inside it is incredible you have all these pre-trained state-ofthe-art open source models they could be open source they could be from one of our partners it could be created by us like Nvidia mull it is packaged up with all of its dependencies so Cuda the right version CNN the right version tensor RT llm Distributing across the multiple gpus Tred and inference server all completely packaged together it's optimized depending on whether you have a single GPU multi- GPU or multi node of gpus it's optimized for that and it's connected up with apis that are simple to use now this think about what an AI API is an AI API is an interface that you just talk to and so this is a piece of software in the future that has a really simple API and that API called human and these packages incredible bodies of software will be optimized and packaged and we'll put it on a website and you can download it you could take it with you you could run it in any Cloud you can run it in your own data center you can run in workstations if it fit and all you have to do is come to ai. nvidia.com we call it Nvidia inference microservice but inside the company we all call it Nims okay just imagine you know one of some someday there there's going to be one of these chat Bots and these chat Bots is going to just be in a Nim and you you'll uh you'll assemble a whole bunch of chat Bots and that's the way software is going to be be built someday how do we build software in the future it is unlikely that you'll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of python code or anything like that it is very likely that you assemble a team of AIS there's probably going to be a super AI that you use that takes the mission that you give it and breaks it down into an execution plan some of that execution plan could be handed off to another Nim that Nim would maybe uh understand sap the language of sap is abap it might understand service now and it go retrieve some information from their platforms it might then hand that result to another Nim who that goes off and does some calculation on it maybe it's an optimization software a combinatorial optimization algorithm maybe it's uh you know some just some basic calculator maybe it's pandas to do some numerical analysis on it and then it comes back with its answer and it gets combined with everybody else's and it because it's been presented with this is what the right answer should look like it knows what answer what an what right answers to produce and it presents it to you we can get a report every single day at you know top of the hour uh that has something to do with a bill plan or some forecast or uh some customer alert or some bugs database or whatever it happens to be and we could assemble it using all these Nims and because these Nims have been packaged up and ready to work on your systems so long as you have video gpus in your data center in the cloud this this Nims will work together as a team and do amazing things and so we decided this is such a great idea we're going to go do that and so Nvidia has Nims running all over the company we have chatbots being created all over the place and one of the mo most important chatbots of course is a chip designer chatbot you might not be surprised we care a lot about building chips and so we want to build chatbots AI co-pilots that are co-designers with our engineers and so this is the way we did it so we got ourselves a llama llama 2 this is a 70b and it's you know packaged up in a NM and we asked it you know uh what is a CTL Well turns out CTL is an internal uh program and it has a internal proprietary language but it thought the CTL was a combinatorial timing logic and so it describes you know conventional knowledge of CTL but that's not very useful to us and so we gave it a whole bunch of new examples you know this is no different than employee onboarding an employee uh we say you know thanks for that answer it's completely wrong um and and uh and then we present to them uh this is what a CTL is okay and so this is what a CTL is at Nvidia and the CTL as you can see you know CTL stands for compute Trace Library which makes sense you know we were tracing compute Cycles all the time and it wrote the program isn't that amazing and so the productivity of our chip designers can go up this is what you can do with a Nim first thing you can do with is customize it we have a service called Nemo microservice that helps you curate the data preparing the data so that you could teach this on board this AI you fine-tune them and then you guardrail it you can even evaluate the answer evaluate its performance against um other other examples and so that's called the Nemo micr service now the thing that's that's emerging here is this there are three elements three pillars of what we're doing the first pillar is of course inventing the technology for um uh AI models and running AI models and packaging it up for you the second is to create tools to help you modify it first is having the AI technology second is to help you modify it and third is infrastructure for you to fine-tune it and if you like deploy it you could deploy it on our infrastructure called dgx cloud or you can employ deploy it on Prem you can deploy it anywhere you like once you develop it it's yours to take anywhere and so we are effectively an AI Foundry we will do for you and the industry on AI what tsmc does for us building chips and so we go to it with our go to tsmc with our big Ideas they manufacture and we take it with us and so exactly the same thing here AI Foundry and the three pillar ERS are the NIMS Nemo microservice and dgx Cloud the other thing that you could teach the Nim to do is to understand your proprietary information remember inside our company the vast majority of our data is not in the cloud it's inside our company it's been sitting there you know being used all the time and and gosh it's it's basically invidious intelligence we would like to take that data learn its meaning like we learned the meaning of almost anything else that we just talked about learn its meaning and then reindex that knowledge into a new type of database called a vector database and so you essentially take structured data or unstructured data you learn its meaning you encode its meaning so now this becomes an AI database and that AI database in the future once you create it you can talk to it and so let me give you an example of what you could do so suppose you create you get you got a whole bunch of multi modality data and one good example of that is PDF so you take the PDF you take all of your PDFs all the all your favorite you know the stuff that that is proprietary to you critical to your company you can encode it just as we encoded pixels of a cat and it becomes the word cat we can encode all of your PDF and it turns into vectors that are now stored inside your vector database it becomes the proprietary information of your company and once you have that proprietary information you can chat to it it's an it's a smart database and so you just ch chat with data and how how much more enjoyable is that you know we for for our software team you know they just chat with the bugs database you know how many bugs was there last night um are we making any progress and then after you're done talking to this uh bugs database you need therapy and so so we have another chatbot for you you can do it okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the reason for that is because ultimately it's job is to go retrieve information as quickly as possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve me this information it goes if brings it back to you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay and so we call it the Nemo retriever well the Nemo service helps you create all these things and we have all all these different Nims we even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel your AI care manager okay so so it's a really short clip but there were so many videos to show you I guess so many other demos to show you and so I I had to cut this one short but this is Diana she is a digital human Nim and and uh you just talked to her and she's connected in this case to Hippocratic ai's large language model for healthcare and it's truly amazing she is just super smart about Healthcare things you know and so after you're done after my my Dwight my VP of software engineering talks to the chatbot for bugs database then you come over here and talk to Diane and and so so uh Diane is is um completely animated with AI and she's a digital human uh there's so many companies that would like to build they're sitting on gold mines the the Enterprise IT industry is sitting on a gold mine it's a gold mine because they have so much understanding of of uh the way work is done they have all these amazing tools that have been created over the years and they're sitting on a lot of data if they could take that gold mine and turn them into co-pilots these co-pilots could help us do things and so just about every it franchise it platform in the world that has valuable tools that people use is sitting on a gold mine for co-pilots and they would like to build their own co-pilots and their own chatbots and so we're announcing that Nvidia AI foundary is working with some of the world's great companies sap generates 87% of the world's Global Commerce basically the world runs on sap we run on sap Nvidia and sap are building sap Jewel co-pilots uh using Nvidia Nemo and dgx cloud service now they run 80 85% of the world's Fortune 500 companies run their people and customer service operations on service now and they're using Nvidia AI Foundry to build service now uh assist virtual assistance cohesity backs up the world's data they're sitting on a gold mine of data hundreds of exobytes of data over 10,000 companies Nvidia AI Foundry is working with them helping them build their Gaia generative AI agent snowflake is a company that stores the world's uh digital Warehouse in the cloud and serves over 3 billion queries a day for 10,000 Enterprise customers snowflake is working with Nvidia AI Foundry to build co-pilots with Nvidia Nemo and Nims net apppp nearly half of the files in the world are stored on Prem on net apppp Nvidia AI Foundry is helping them uh build chat Bots and co-pilots like those Vector databases and retrievers with Nvidia neemo and Nims and we have a great partnership with Dell everybody who everybody who is building these chat Bots and generative AI when you're ready to run it you're going to need an AI Factory and nobody is better at Building end-to-end Systems of very large scale for the Enterprise than Dell and so anybody any company every company will need to build AI factories and it turns out that Michael is here he's happy to take your order ladies and gentlemen Michael del okay let's talk about the next wave of Robotics the next wave of AI robotics physical AI so far all of the AI that we've talked about is one computer data comes into one computer lots of the world's if you will experience in digital text form the AI imitates Us by reading a lot of the language to predict the next words it's imitating You by studying all of the patterns and all the other previous examples of course it has to understand context and so on so forth but once it understands the context it's essentially imitating you we take all of the data we put it into a system like dgx we compress it into a large language model trillions and trillions of parameters become billions and billion trillions of tokens becomes billions of parameters these billions of parameters becomes your AI well in order for us to go to the next wave of AI where the AI understands the physical world we're going to need three computers the first computer is still the same computer it's that AI computer that now is going to be watching video and maybe it's doing synthetic data generation and maybe there's a lot of human examples just as we have human examples in text form we're going to have human examples in articulation form and the AIS will watch us understand what is happening and try to adapt it for themselves into the context and because it can generalize with these Foundation models maybe these robots can also perform in the physical world fairly generally so I just described in very simple terms essentially what just happened in large language models except the chat GPT moment for robotics may be right around the corner and so we've been building the end to-end systems for robotics for some time I'm super super proud of the work we have the AI system dgx we have the lower system which is called agx for autonomous systems the world's first robotics processor when we first built this thing people are what are you guys building it's a s so it's one chip it's designed to be very low power but it's designed for high-speed sensor processing and Ai and so if you want to run Transformers in a car or you want to run Transformers in a in a you know anything um that moves uh we have the perfect computer for you it's called the Jetson and so the dgx on top for training the AI the Jetson is the autonomous processor and in the middle we need another computer whereas large language models have the benefit of you providing your examples and then doing reinforcement learning human feedback what is the reinforcement learning human feedback of a robot well it's reinforcement learning physical feedback that's how you align the robot that's how you that's how the robot knows that as it's learning these articulation capabilities and manipulation capabilities it's going to adapt properly into the laws of physics and so we need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot we call that virtual world Omniverse and the computer that runs Omniverse is called ovx and ovx the computer itself is hosted in the Azure Cloud okay and so basically we built these three things these three systems on top of it we have algorithms for every single one now I'm going to show you one super example of how Ai and Omniverse are going to work together the example I'm going to show you is kind of insane but it's going to be very very close to tomorrow it's a robotics building this robotics building is called a warehouse inside the robotics building are going to be some autonomous systems some of the autonomous systems are going to be called humans and some of the autonomous systems are going to be called forklifts and these autonomous systems are going to interact with each other of course autonomously and it's going to be overlooked upon by this Warehouse to keep everybody out of Harm's Way the warehouse is essentially an air traffic controller and whenever it sees something happening it will redirect traffic traffic and give New Way points just new way points to the robots and the people and they'll know exactly what to do this warehouse this building you can also talk to of course you could talk to it hey you know sap Center how are you feeling today for example and so you could ask the same the warehouse the same questions basically the system I just described will have Omniverse Cloud that's hosting the virtual simulation and AI running on djx cloud and all of this is running in real time let's take a look the future of heavy industri starts as a digital twin the AI agents helping robots workers and infrastructure navigate unpredictable events in complex industrial spaces will be built and evaluated first in sophisticated digital twins this Omniverse digital twin of a 100,000 ft Warehouse is operating as a simulation environment that integrates digital workers amrs running the Nvidia Isaac receptor stack centralized activity maps of the entire Warehouse from 100 simulated ceiling mount cameras using Nvidia metropolis and AMR route planning with Nvidia Koop software in Loop testing of AI agents in this physically accurate simulated environment enables us to evaluate and refine how the system adapts to real world unpredictability here an incident occurs along this amr's planned route blocking its path as it moves to pick up a pallet Nvidia Metropolis updates and sends a realtime occupancy map to kopt where a new optimal route is calculated the AMR is enabled to see around corners and improve its Mission efficiency with generative AI powered Metropolis Vision Foundation models operators can even ask questions using natural language the visual model understands nuanced activity and can offer immediate insights to improve operations all of the sensor data is created in simulation and passed to the real-time AI running as Nvidia inference microservices or Nims and when the AI is ready to be deployed in the physical twin the real Warehouse we connect metropolis and Isaac Nims to real sensors with the ability for continuous Improvement of both the digital twin and the AI models isn't that incredible and so remember remember a future facility Warehouse Factory building will be software defined and so the software is running how else would you test the software so you you you test the software to building the warehouse the optimization system in the digital twin what about all the robots all of those robots you are seeing just now they're all running their own autonomous robotic stack and so the way you integrate software in the future cicd in the future for robotic systems is with digital twins we've made Omniverse a lot easier to access we're going to create basically Omniverse Cloud apis four simple API and a channel and you can connect your application to it so this is this is going to be as wonderfully beautifully simple in the future that Omniverse is going to be and with these apis you're going to have these magical digital twin capability we also have turned om ver into an AI and integrated it with the ability to chat USD the the language of our language is you know human and Omniverse is language as it turns out is universal scene description and so that language is rather complex and so we've taught our Omniverse uh that language and so you can speak to it in English and it would directly generate USD and it would talk back in USD but Converse back to you in English you could also look for information in this world semantically instead of the world being encoded semantically in in language now it's encoded semantically in scenes and so you could ask it of of uh certain objects or certain conditions and certain scenarios and it can go and find that scenario for you it also can collaborate with you in generation you could design some things in 3D it could simulate some things in 3D or you could use AI to generate something in 3D let's take a look at how this is all going to work we have a great partnership with Seamans Seamans is the world's largest industrial engineering and operations platform you've seen now so many different companies in the industrial space heavy Industries is one of the greatest final frontiers of it and we finally now have the Necessary Technology to go and make a real impact seens is building the industrial metaverse and today we're announcing that Seamans is connecting their Crown Jewel accelerator to Nvidia Omniverse let's take a look seens technology is transformed every day for everyone team Center acts our leading product life cycle management software from the sems accelerator platform is used every day by our customers to develop and deliver products at scale now we are bringing the real and the digital worlds even Closer by integrating Nvidia Ai and Omniverse Technologies into team Center X Omniverse apis enable data interoperability and physics-based rendering to Industrial scale design and Manufacturing projects our customers HD market leader in sustainable ship manufacturing builds ammonia and hydrogen power chips often comprising over 7 million discrete Parts with Omniverse apis team Center X lets companies like HD yundai unify and visualize these massive engineering data sets interactively and integrate generative AI to generate 3D objects or HDR I backgrounds to see their projects in context the result an ultra inuitive photoal physics-based digital twin that eliminates waste and errors delivering huge savings in cost and time and we are building this for collaboration whether across more semens accelerator tools like seens anex or Star CCM Plus or across teams working on their favorite devices in the same scene together in this is just the beginning working with Nvidia we will bring accelerated Computing generative Ai and Omniverse integration across the Sean accelerator portfolio the pro the the professional the professional voice actor happens to be a good friend of mine Roland Bush who happens to be the CEO of seens once you get Omniverse connected into your workflow your ecosystem from the beginning of your design to engineering to manufacturing planning all the way to digital twin operations once you connect everything together it's insane how much productivity you can get and it's just really really wonderful all of a sudden everybody is operating on the same ground truth you don't have to exchange data and convert data make mistakes everybody is working on the same ground truth from the design Department to the art Department the architecture Department all the way to the engineering and even the marketing department let's take a look at how Nissan has integrated Omniverse into their workflow and it's all because it's connected by all these wonderful tools and these developers that we're working with take a look unbel for for that was not an animation that was Omniverse today we're announcing that Omniverse Cloud streams to The Vision Pro and it is very very strange that you walk around virtual doors when I was getting out of that car and everybody does it it is really really quite amazing Vision Pro connected to Omniverse portals you into Omniverse and because all of these CAD tools and all these different design tools are now integrated and connected to Omniverse you can have this type of workflow really incredible let's talk about robotics everything that moves will be robotic there's no question about that it's safer it's more convenient and one of the largest Industries is going to be Automotive we build the robotic stack from top to bottom as I was mentioned from the computer system but in the case of self-driving cars including the self-driving application at the end of this year or I guess beginning of next year we will be shipping in Mercedes and then shortly after that jlr and so these autonomous robotic systems are software defined they take a lot of work to do has computer vision has obviously artificial intelligence control and planning all kinds of very complicated technology and takes years to refine we're building the entire stack however we open up our entire stack for all of the automotive industry this is just the way we work the way we work in every single industry we try to build as much of it as we can so that we understand it but then we open it up so everybody can access it whether you would like to buy just our computer which is the world's only full functional save asld system that can run AI this functional safe asld quality computer or the operating system on top or of course our data centers which is in basically every AV company in the world however you would like to enjoy it we're delighted by it today we're announcing that byd the world's largest ev company is adopting our next Generation it's called Thor Thor is designed for Transformer engines Thor our next Generation AV computer will be used by byd you probably don't know this fact that we have over a million robotics developers we created Jetson this robotics computer we're so proud of it the amount of software that goes on top of it is insane but the reason why we can do it at all is because it's 100% Cuda compatible everything that we do everything that we do in our company is in service of our developers and by us being able to maintain this Rich ecosystem and make it compatible with everything that you access from us we can bring all of that incredible capability to this little tiny computer we call Jetson a robotics computer we also today are announcing this incredibly Advanced new SDK we call it Isaac perceptor Isaac perceptor most most of the Bots today are pre-programmed they're either following rails on the ground digital rails or theyd be following April tags but in the future they're going to have perception and the reason why you want that is so that you could easily program it you say would you like to go from point A to point B and it will figure out a way to navigate its way there so by only programming waypoints the entire route could be adaptive the entire environment could be reprogrammed just as I showed you at the very beginning with the warehouse you can't do that with pre-programmed agvs if those boxes fall down they just all gum up and they just wait there for somebody to come clear it and so now with the Isaac perceptor we have incredible state-of-the-art Vision odometry 3D reconstruction and in addition to 3D reconstruction depth perception the reason for that is so that you can have two modalities to keep an eye on what's happening in the world Isaac perceptor the most used robot today is the manipulator manufacturing arms and they are also pre-programmed the computer vision algorithms the AI algorithms the control and path planning algorithms that are geometry aware incredibly computational intensive we have made these Cuda accelerated so we have the world's first Cuda accelerated motion planner that is geometry aware you put something in front of it it comes up with a new plan and our articulates around it it has excellent perception for pose estimation of a 3D object not just not it's pose in 2D but it's pose in 3D so it has to imagine what's around and how best to grab it so the foundation pose the grip foundation and the um articulation algorithms are now available we call it Isaac manipulator and they also uh just run on nvidia's computers we are are starting to do some really great work in the next generation of Robotics the next generation of Robotics will likely be a humanoid robotics we now have the Necessary Technology and as I was describing earlier the Necessary Technology to imagine generalized human robotics in a way human robotics is likely easier and the reason for that is because we have a lot more imitation training data that we can provide there robots because we are constructed in a very similar way it is very likely that the human robotics will be much more useful in our world because we created the world to be something that we can interoperate in and work well in and the way that we set up our workstations and Manufacturing and Logistics they were designed for for humans they were designed for people and so these human robotics will likely be much more productive to deploy while we're creating just like we're doing with the others the entire stack starting from the top a foundation model that learns from watching video human IM human examples it could be in video form it could be in virtual reality form we then created a gym for it called Isaac reinforcement learning gym which allows the humanoid robot to learn how to adapt to the physical world and then an incredible computer the same computer that's going to go into a robotic car this computer will run inside a human or robot called Thor it's designed for Transformer engines we've combined several of these into one video this is something that you're going to really love take a look it's not enough for humans to imagine we have to invent and explore real and push Beyond what's been done fair amount of detail we create smarter and faster we push it to fail so it can learn we teach it then help it teach itself we broaden its understanding to take on new challenges with absolute precision and succeed we make it perceive and move and even reason so it can share our world with us this is where inspiration leads us the next Frontier this is Nvidia Project Groot a general purpose Foundation model for humanoid robot learning the group model takes multimodal instructions and past interactions as input and produces the next action for the robot to execute we developed Isaac lab a robot learning application to train gr on Omniverse Isaac Sim and we scale out with osmo a new compute orchestration service that coordinates work flows across dgx systems for training and ovx systems for simulation with these tools we can train Groot in physically based simulation and transfer zero shot to the real world the Groot model will enable a robot to learn from a handful of human demonstrations so it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us this is made possible with nvidia's technologies that can understand humans from videos train models and simulation and ultimately deploy them directly to physical robots connecting group to a large language model even allows it to generate motions by following natural language instructions hi go1 can you give me a high five sure thing let's high five can you give us some cool moves sure check this out all this incredible intelligence is powered by the new Jetson Thor robotics chips designed for Groot built for the future with Isaac lab osmo and Groot we're providing the building blocks for the next generation of AI powered robotics about the same size the soul of Nvidia the intersection of computer Graphics physics artificial intelligence it all came to bear at this moment the name of that project general robotics 003 I know super good super good well I think we have some special guests do we hey guys so I understand you guys are powered by Jetson they're powered by Jetson little Jetson robotics computers inside they learn to walk in Isaac Sim ladies and gentlemen this this is orange and this is the famous green they are the bdx robots of Disney amazing Disney research come on you guys let's wrap up let's go five things where you going I sit right here Don't Be Afraid come here green hurry up what are you saying no it's not time to eat it's not time to I'll I'll give you a snack in a moment let me finish up real quick come on green hurry up stop wasting time five things five things first a new Industrial Revolution every data center should be accelerated a trillion dollars worth of installed data centers will become modernized over the next several years second because of the computational capability we brought to bear a new way of doing software has emerged generative AI which is going to create new in new infrastructure dedicated to doing one thing and one thing only not for multi-user data centers but AI generators these AI generation will create incredibly valuable software a new Industrial Revolution second the computer of this revolution the computer of this generation generative AI trillion parameters blackw insane amounts of computers and computing third I'm trying to concentrate good job third new computer new computer creates new types of software new type of software should be distributed in a new way so that it can on the one hand be an endpoint in the cloud and easy to use but still allow you to take it with you because it is your intelligence your intelligence should be pack packaged up in a way that allows you to take it with you we call them Nims and third these Nims are going to help you create a new type of application for the future not one that you wrote completely from scratch but you're going to integrate them like teams create these applications we have a fantastic capability between Nims the AI technology the tools Nemo and the infrastructure dgx cloud in our AI Foundry to help you create proprietary applications proprietary chat Bots and then lastly everything that moves in the future will be robotic you're not going to be the only one and these robotic systems whether they are humanoid amrs self-driving cars forklifts manipulating arms they will all need one thing Giant stadiums warehouses factories there can to be factories that are robotic orchestrating factories uh manufacturing lines that are robotics building cars that are robotics these systems all need one thing they need a platform a digital platform a digital twin platform and we call that Omniverse the operating system of the robotics World these are the five things that we talked about today what does Nvidia look like what does Nvidia look like when we talk about gpus there's a very different image that I have when I when people ask me about gpus first I see a bunch of software stacks and things like that and second I see this this is what we announce to you today this is Blackwell this is the plat amazing amazing processors MV link switches networking systems and the system design is a miracle this is Blackwell and this to me is what a GPU looks like in my mind listen orange green I think we have one more treat for everybody what do you think should we okay we have one more thing to show you roll it he m yeah thank you thank you have a great have a great GTC thank you all for coming thank you Build me car on an empty road. Hello, I'm James, a digital human. Feel free to ask me anything about NVIDIAand its products. Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats and welcome to the stage, NVIDIA Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. Hello, Japan! Hello, Japan. Welcome to NVIDIA AI Summit. Everything you saw just now was simulated. Everything was simulation. No animation. At the core, NVIDIA is asimulation technology company. We simulate physics. We simulate virtual worlds, we simulate intelligence. Through our simulations, we help you predict the future. So in many ways, NVIDIA builds time machines. Today we're going to talk to youabout some of our latest breakthroughs. But most importantly, this is an eventabout the Japan ecosystem. We have so many partners here. 350 startups, 250,000 developers, hundreds of companies. We've been cominghere for a very long time. Japan has been very dear to ussince the very early foundings of our company. It is here in Japan we did many firsts,many firsts for NVIDIA. It was our first game developerthat worked with us. SEGA, Yu Suzuki, the famous developer, 3D game developer,who first worked with us to port SEGA's incredible3D games to NVIDIA's GPUs. It was the first time that someone used NVIDIA CUDAto build a supercomputer. The Tsubame 1.2 at Tokyo Tech, which enabled NVIDIAto utilize our GPUs to advance scientific computing. Japan has been first in so many ways. It was also the first time thatwe were able to create mobile processors, which led to one of our very, very dear projects,the Nintendo Switch. So many firsts. Now we're in the beginning of a new age. The AI revolution: a new industry,extraordinary technology changes. This is a time that is very exciting,but it's also very critical. So we're here to partnerwith the Japan ecosystem, the amazing companies here,to bring AI to Japan. So that we can all together take advantage of thisextraordinary opportunity ahead of us. We have many partners here todaythat I would like to thank GMO Internet Group,Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, MITSUI and Companyare the platinum sponsors. I want to thank all of you for that. Thank you. And 56 other sponsors. Thank you all for comingand thank you for supporting us. NVIDIA invented accelerated computing. Accelerated computing does not replace the CPU. In fact, we were just about the only companyin computing who did not want to replace the CPU,but to augment the CPU, so that we can take the workloadsthat are very computationally intensive and offload them onto the GPU. These are GPUs, that's the CPU. Working together, we can take advantage of the bestcapabilities of both processors, one that is extremely good atsequential processing, the CPU, and a processor that's incredibly goodat parallel processing, called the GPU. This I'll talk about in just a second. But this is accelerated computing. Not just parallel computing,but accelerated computing. CPU and GPU working together. This computing model is brand new to the world. In fact, just using the CPU has been around since 1964,the year after my birth. 60 years in the making. The vast majority of everything we see in the world todayrunning on computers are running on CPUs. But there's a new change, a fundamentalchange in the computing model. But in order to do that,you cannot just take the CPU software that's running sequentiallyand put it on a GPU to run parallel. We have to create a whole bunch of newalgorithms. Just as OpenGL made it possible for computergraphics applications to connect to accelerationthrough the graphics processor, we had to create many domain-specific libraries like OpenGL,but for many different applications. These are some of the 350 different libraries we have in our company,some very, very important libraries. CuLitho was for computational lithography,takes computational lithography. Making the mask of chips may require many, many weeksbecause there are so many layers. We take many weeks of computationand reduce it down to hours. We could, of course,speed up the cycle time of building chips, but very importantly,we also make it possible to advance the algorithms of lithographymuch, much more sophisticated so that we canadvance semiconductor physics well beyond two nanometers,one nanometer and beyond. So computational lithographyis going to be accelerated by cuLitho. CuDSS for Sparse Solver, AI Aerial— I'll talk about that today. An incredible new library that makes it possiblefor this computer to run the 5G radio stack. Basically a radio in real timerunning on the CUDA accelerator. CUDA-Q for quantum simulation, quantumcircuit simulations, Parabricks for gene sequencing, cuVS for vector storage,or vector databases for indexing and queryingvector databases that is used for AI. CuPyNumeric is a numerical processing library. NumPy is the most popularnumerical processing library in the world. Five million different developers use it. It has been downloaded 30 million timesjust last month. Incredible number of downloads. It is now fully accelerated for multi-GPUmulti-node. CuPyNumeric, please go look it up.It's incredible. CuDF for data frame processing, structured data processinglike SQL, Pandas, Polars. CuOPT, the classic incredibly complicatedtraveling salesperson problem. This problem has now been acceleratedfor CuOPT, hundreds of times faster. Modulus for AI physics, and then one of the most importantlibraries we ever created, called cuDNN. CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes the different layers, the various layersof the deep learning stack. It enabled usto do something extraordinary. By creating cuDNN, and acceleratingand democratizing deep learning, we made it possible in the last decade to scale artificial intelligence and scale machine learning by 1 million times. Increasing the scale of machine learningby 1 million times enabled, of course, the incredible breakthroughthat we now know—ChatGPT. The advent of artificial intelligence. CuDNN did something very special. It enabled a change in the way that software is done. This is the way that software was donebefore. Software 1.0. Software programmers writing code to describe an algorithm—that's a function. That function is software. You then apply input, it predicts an output. That code written by human runsbest on CPUs. Software 1.0 was coding, writing software that runs on CPUs. Software 2.0, because the computer is now so incredibly fast, you can give it an enormous amount of examples—observed data— so that it can learn, it can predictwhat the function is by itself. We call that software 2.0. So instead of coding,it is now machine learning. Instead of code running on CPU,it is now neural networks running on GPUs. And neural networks, these neural networksthat are running on GPUs is now the formation of a new operating system, a new way of using computers. The operating system of the moderncomputer, Large Language Models. This machine learning approach has proven to be incredibly scalable. You can use it for all kinds of things. Of course, digitized text, languages, of course, digitized sound,speech, images, video. It could be multimodal. You could teach it amino acid sequences. You could teach it to understandjust about anything, anything where you have large observed data. Well, that was the first step, was to understandthe meaning of the data. Just by studying an enormousamount of text on the internet, we were able to understand the words, the vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and even the meaning of the words. by finding patterns and relationships. Using the same approach, we're now able to not only understand the meaningof the different data types, connect it to different modalities—for example words and images. Connect the image of the word 'cat' and the image of a catare now connected together, learning a multi-modality. We can now even translate and generate, so we can understand data of all kinds, and we can generate intelligent information,intelligence of all kinds. Well, if you look at all the amazing startupsthat are being created and the amazing applications that are being created,you can find it in this slide in one of the two combinations. One side to the other side, Text to text, would be summarization, question and answering, text generation, storytelling. Video to text wouldbe captioning. Image to text—image recognition. Text to images— image generation like Midjourney. Text to video—video creationlike Runway ML. All of these different combinationsare truly breakthrough. You can even have proteins to text, explain what a protein does. Text to chemicals,describe properties of a chemical that might be a successful drugfor drug discovery. You can even have video and textto machine articulation, robotics. Each one of these combinations is a new industry,new company, new application use case, incredible Cambrian explosionof the number of applications have now been created. And we're just at the beginning. One of the properties of machine learning,of course, is that the larger the brain, the more data we can teach it, the smarter it becomes. We call it the scaling law. There's every evidence that as we scale up the size of the models,the amount of training data, the effectiveness, the quality, the performanceof the intelligence improves. Every single year, the industry is scaling upthe size of the models by 2X or so, which correspondingly need 2X the data, and therefore we need 4Xthe amount of compute. The amount of computing resource necessaryto drive to the next level of artificial intelligenceis extraordinary. We call that the scaling law, the training scaling law. Pre-training is part of it, post-training is part of it. Post-training with reinforcementlearning, human feedback, reinforcement learning, AI feedback. So many different ways now of using synthetic data generationin the post-training stage. So training, pre-training,post-training is enjoying very significant scaling and we're continuingto see excellent results. Well, when Strawberry orOpenAI’s o1 was announced, it exposed the worldto a new type of inference. Inference is when you interact with the AI, just like ChatGPT. But ChatGPT is one shot. You ask it a question,you ask it to do something for you. Whatever question you have, whatever prompts you provide, through one shot,it delivers an answer. However, we know that thinking is oftentimesmore than just one shot, and thinking requires us to maybe domulti-plans, multiple potential answersthat we choose the best one from. Just like when we're thinking. We might reflect on the answerbefore we deliver the answer. Reflection. We might take a problem and break it down into step by stepby step, chain of thought. There are many different technologiesthat we've invented that makes it possible for inference to perform better and better as we apply more and more compute. Now we have the second scaling law: inference scaling law. Not just generation of the next word,but thinking, reflecting, planning. These two simultaneous scale lawsare going to require us to drive computing at extraordinary speeds. Every single time when we deliver a new generation,a new architecture, we increase the performance by X factors, but we also decrease the powerby the same X factor. We decrease the cost by the same X factor. So driving up performance is exactlythe same as reducing cost. Driving up the performance is exactlythe same as reducing energy. And so therefore as the world continuesto absorb and embrace artificial intelligence, it is our mission, it is our duty, it is our duty, to continue to drive theperformance up as fast as we can. In the process, expanding the reach of artificial intelligence,driving up its effectiveness, driving down its cost,driving down its power consumption. That's the reasonwhy we went to a one year cycle. However, AI is not a chip problem. These AI systems are enormous. This is the Blackwell system. Blackwell is the name of a GPU, but it'salso the name of this entire system. The GPU is extraordinary in itself. There are two Blackwell dies. Each Blackwell die is the largest chipthe world's ever made. 104 billion transistors made by TSMC and their mostadvanced four nanometer node. Two of these Blackwell dies are connected togetheracross 10TB/s, low energy link. Right in the middle,right there, that line, that seam. Thousands of interconnections between the two dies.Ten terabytes per second. It's connected by eight HBM3E memories from SK Hynixand from Micron. And these memories togetherrun at 8 TB/s. And 8 TB/s, these two GPUs are connected to the CPU with another low, very low energy, very energy efficient series, 1 TB/s. Each one of the GPUs are connectedthrough NVLink at 1.8 TB/s. That's a lot of terabytes per second. And the reason for thatis because this system cannot work alone. Even the most advanced computerthe world has ever made cannot work alonefor artificial intelligence. Sometimes it has to work with thousandsof other computers like this, nodes like this, together as one computer,and sometimes they have to work separately because they are respondingto a different customer, different query. So sometimes separately,sometimes as one. In order to enable the GPUs to work as one,we of course have networking, two ConnectX-7s that connect this GPU with thousands of other GPUs, but we still need this NVLink. This NVLink allows us to connect the few GPUs in one rackthat's standing behind me. That one rack behind me,that one rack is connected to, with this NVLink 5.0, 1.8TB per second, 35 times higher bandwidth than the highestbandwidth networking in the world, which allows us to connectall of these GPUs together to this NVLink switch. There are nine NVLink switches in one rack. Each rack has 72 computers like this connected through this spine. This is the NVLink spine. This is cables, copper. 50 pounds of copper, driven directly by this incredible series, incredible IO we call NVLink. They connect into, connect into the computer, into NVLink this way, and this switch connects all of these computers together as one. And so what results, are 72 of these computers connected as one large GPU. One incredibly large GPU. From the software perspective,it is just one giant chip, and these racks, these NVLinked 72 systems. This one rack. This one rack is 3,000 pounds. It is impossible to put on this stageotherwise I'd show it to you. That is 3,000 pounds and 120kW. That is, I have my my friends here. That's many, many Nintendo Switch power. It is not portable but it's very powerful. And so this is the Blackwell system. We designed this so that it can beconfigured as one superpod like this, or one entire gigantic data center with thousands and thousands of them,hopefully hundreds of thousands of them, And they're connected to themby the switches. Some of them are Quantum InfiniBand switches. If you want to have a dedicated AI factoryor a Spectrum-X, NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionary ethernet system that you can integrate into your existing ethernet environments. We can build AI supercomputers with these, we can integrate them into enterprisedata centers, into hyperscalers, or configure them for the edge. The Blackwell systemis not only incredibly powerful, it is also incredibly adaptable,so that it can fit into every corner of the world'scomputing infrastructure. So this is this is Blackwell. On top of Blackwell,of course, is the computer. But most importantly,without all of the software that runs on top of it, this computer is justsimply impossible to operate. When you see these computerswith all of the liquid cooling, all of the wiring,the mind will blow up. How do you programsuch an incredible computer? This is where NVIDIA's software stack,this is where all of our effort in CUDA, NCCL, all of our Megatron, Megatron-Core, all of the software that we created,TensorRT LLM, Triton, all of the software that we created overthe years integrated into the system,makes it possible for everyone, anyone, to deployAI supercomputers around the world. And then, of course, on top we have AI softwarethat makes it easy for people to build AI. And so what is AI? What is AI? We talk about AIin a lot of different ways, but I think there are two types of AIsthat will be extremely popular. And there are two mental modelsthat I think are very helpful. It's very helpful to me. The first AI is basically a digital AI worker. These AI workers can understand, they can plan and they can take action. Sometimes the digital AI workers are being asked to execute a marketing campaign, support a customer, come up with a manufacturing supplychain plan, optimize a chip, help us write software. Maybe be a research assistant, a lab assistant in the drug discovery industry. Maybe this agent you know is a tutor to the CEO. Maybe there's a tutorfor all of our employees. These AI, these digital AI workers,we call them AI agents are essentially like digital employees. And just like digital employees,you have to train them. You have to create datato welcome them to your company, teach them about your company. You train them for their particular skills, depending on what functionyou would like them to have, you evaluate themafter you're done training them to make sure that they learnedwhat they're supposed to learn, you guardrail themto make sure that they perform the job they're asked to do, and not the jobsthey're not asked to do. And of course, you operate them, you deploy them. Provide them energy from Blackwell, the AI tokens from Blackwell. And they interact with other agentsto work as a team to solve problems. Well, you're goingto see all kinds of different agents. And we created several thingsto make it easier for the ecosystem to be ableto build AI agents for companies. NVIDIA is not in the service business. And we don't create, we don't deliverfinal product, we don't deliver solutions, but we do deliver the enabling technologyto make it possible for the ecosystem to create AI, to deliver AI, to continuously improve AI. The AI agent lifecycle libraries, the lifecycle platform is called NeMo, and NeMo has libraries for each one of the stages that I mentioned,from data curation to training, to fine tuning to synthetic data generationto evaluation, to guard railing. And these libraries are integrated into workflowsand frameworks all over the world. We're working with AI startups, service providerslike Accenture and Deloitte, companies all over the world to bring thisto all of the large companies. We also work with ISVs like ServiceNow so that they can create agentsthat use ServiceNow. Today, you use ServiceNowby licensing the platform and your employees interact with the ServiceNow platformto get assistance. In the future, ServiceNow will also provide a large number of AI agentsthat you can rent. Essentially digital employees that you canrent to help you solve problems. We're working with ServiceNow,we're working with SAP, Cadence, Ansys, companiesall over the world, Snowflake, companies all over the worldso that we can all build agents that can be helpful to youin driving productivity in your company. Now, these agents are able to understand, reason, plan, take action. And these agents are collections or systems of AI models. It's not just one AI model, but a system of AI models. And NeMo helps us build those. We also create pre-trained AI models that we package up inwhat is called a NIM. And so these NIMs are microservices. They're basically AI packaged. In the old days,software was packaged in a box and they'd come delivered with CD-ROMs. Today, AI is packaged in a microservice andinside the software is smart. You could talk to the softwareand you could talk to the software because it understands what you mean,and you can connect the software with other software. You can connect thisAI with other AI, and together you could createessentially an agent, an AI agent. So this is the first thing. Let me give youan example of some of these agents. Agenetic AI is transforming every enterprise using sophisticatedreasoning and iterative planning to solve complex,multi-step problems. AI agents help marketing campaigns go live faster with instant insights,helping optimize supply chain operations, saving hundreds of millions in costs,and reduce software security processes from days to seconds by helping analyststriage vulnerabilities. What makes agenticAI so powerful is its ability to turn data into knowledge,and knowledge into action. A digital agent in this examplecan educate individuals with insights from a set of informationally denseresearch papers. It was built using NVIDIA AI Blueprints. These are reference workflowsfeaturing NVIDIA acceleration libraries, SDKs, and NIM microservices that help you rapidly buildand deploy AI apps. The multi-modal PDF Data ExtractionBlueprint helps build a data ingest pipeline,while the Digital Human Blueprint provides smooth, human-like interactions. “Hi, I’m James.� A digital agent ingests PDF researchpapers, including complex data like images, chartsand tables, and generates a high level summary delivered throughan interactive digital human interface. “What an exciting breakthrough in weatherforecasting. The development of CorrDiff,a new generative model, is a significant step forwardin accurately predicting weather patterns by combining a U-Net regression modelwith a diffusion model.� James can also answer questions or generate new contentbased on the papers. NVIDIA AI gives enterprisesthe power to automate processes, tap into real timeinsights, and enhance workflow efficiency. AI agents. Three parts: NeMo, NIMs, and Blueprints. These are all references. They're available to you in source formso that you could use it as you like and build your AI agent workforce. None of these agents can do 100% of anyone's task. Anybody's job. None of the agents can do 100%. However, all of the agents will be able to do work for 50% of your work. This is the great achievement. Instead of thinking about AI as replacingthe work of 50% of the people, you should think that AI will do50% of the work for 100% of the people. By thinking that way,you realize that AI will help boost your company'sproductivity, boost your productivity. You know, people have asked me,you know, is AI going to take your job? And I always say, because it's true, AI will not take your job. AI used by somebody else, will take your job. And so be sure to activateusing AI as soon as you can. So the first is digital AI agents. Digital. These are digital AIs. The second application is physical AI. The same basic technology is now embodied, sits inside a mechanical system. Of course, robotics is going to be one of the most importantindustries in the world. Until now, robotics has been limited and the reason is very, very clear. In fact, here in Japan, 50% of the world'smanufacturing robots are built. Kawasaki, FANUC, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi. Four of the leaders that buildhalf of the world's robotic systems. As much as robots have driven the productivity of manufacturing,it has been very difficult to expand. The robotics industryhas been largely flat for a long time. And the reason for thatis because it is too specific. It is not flexible enough. It is not flexible enoughto be able to apply to different scenarios and different conditionsand different work. We need AI that is much, much more flexible,that it can adapt and learn by itself. Notice the technology that we described upuntil now, agentic AI. Irrespective of who you are, you should beable to interact with the agents. It can give you response. Of course, sometimes the response is not as goodas the response that you would produce, but many of them are in facteven better than what we can produce. And so we can now apply this generalAI technology into the world of embodied AI or physical AI,or otherwise known as robotics. In order to enable robotics to happen,we need to build three computers. The first computer is training the AI, just like we did with all of the examplesI've given you so far. Second is to simulate the AI, you need to give theAI a place to practice, a place to learn, a place to retreat, to receive synthetic datathat it can learn from. We call that Omniverse. Omniverse is our virtual worlddigital twin suite of libraries that could be used for creating physical AIs, robotics. Omniverse, then, after validation,after training, after evaluation, then you can take the modeland put it into a physical robot. Inside that we have processorsthat are designed for robotics. We call it Jetson Thor. Thor is a robotics processordesigned for humanoid robots. This loop goes on and on and on. Just as there is a NeMo AI agent life cycle platform, there is this Omniverse platform that enables you to create AI. Well, ultimately, what you want is the AI—notice on the left—it sees a world, tt sees the video,it sees the surrounding, the circumstance. You tell it what you want. And this AI will generate articulation motion. Just as we take text,we can generate video, we can take textand generate chemicals for drugs. We can take text and generate articulation motion. So this concept is very similarto generative AI. And this is the reason why we think that now we have the necessary technologybetween Omniverse and all the computersthat we built, these three computers and the latest generative AI technology, that the time has come for humanoid robotics. Now, why is humanoid robotics so hard? Well, obviously the software developedfor humanoid robots is extremely hard. However, the benefit is incredible. There are only two robotic systems thatcan be easily deployed into the world. The first robot is a self-driving car,and the reason for that is because we created the worldto adapt to cars. The second is humanoid robots. These two robotic systemscould be deployed in brownfields anywhere in the world. Because we created the world for us. This is both extraordinarilyhard technology that the time has come,but the impact can be enormous. Well, this last week at the Conferencefor Robotics Learning, we announced a new frameworkthat is super important. It's called Isaac Lab. Isaac Lab is a reinforcementlearning virtual simulation system that allows you to teach humanoid robotshow to be humanoid robots. And on top of it, we have severalworkflows that we have created. The first workflow is Groot-Mimic. Groot-Mimic is a frameworkfor demonstrating to the robot how to perform a task. You use human demonstration and then mimic that environment, using domain randomization generates hundreds of other exampleslike your demonstration. So that the robot can learn to generalize. Otherwise it can only performthat very specific task. Using Mimic,we can generalize its learning. The second is Groot-Gen. Groot-Gen, using generativeAI technology in Omniverse, we can create an enormous number of random, domain randomized examples of environments and the actionsthat we would like the robot to perform. And so we're generating a whole bunchof tests, evaluation systems, evaluation scenariosthat the robot can try to perform and improve itself, learnhow to be a good robot. And the third is Groot-Control. Groot-Control is a model distillationframework that allows us to take all of the skills that we've learnedand distill it into one unified model that allows the robot to performkinematic skills. Not only will robots be autonomous, but remember thatthe future factories will also be robotic. And so these factoriesare going to be robotic factories that are orchestrating robots, buildingmechanical systems that are robotic. Let me show it to you. Physical AI embodies robots like self-driving carsthat safely navigate the real world, manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks, and humanoid robotswho work collaboratively alongside us. Plants and factories will be embodiedby physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operationsor speaking to us. NVIDIA builds three computers to enable developersto create physical AI. The models are first trained on DGX, then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcementlearning physics feedback in Omniverse. And the trained AI runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX robotics computers. NVIDIA Omniverse is a physics-basedoperating system for physical AI simulation. Robots learn and fine tune their skills in Isaac Lab,a robot gym built on Omniverse. And with GR00T workflows like GR00T-Gen to generate diverselearning environments and layouts, GR00T-Mimic to generate large scalesynthetic motion datasets based on a small number of real-world captures, and GR00T-Controlfor neural whole body control. This is just one robot. Future factories will orchestrate teamsof robots and monitor entire operationsthrough thousands of sensors. For factory digital twins, they use an Omniverseblueprint called Mega. With Mega, the factory digital twin is populatedwith virtual robots and their AI models—the robots' brains. The robots execute a task by perceivingtheir environment, reasoning, planning their next motion,and finally converting it to actions. These actions are simulated in the environmentby the World Simulator in Omniverse, and the results are perceived by the robot brainsthrough Omniverse sensor simulation. Based on the sensor simulations,the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and positionof everything in the factory digital twin. This software in the looptesting brings software defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments,letting industrial enterprises simulate and validate changesin an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world,saving massive risk and cost. The era of physical AI is here, transforming the world'sheavy industries and robotics. Incredible times. So we have two robotic systems. One that's digital. We call AI agents,and you use them in your office, collaborating with your employees. And then the second is a physical AI,physical AI system, robotics. And these physical AIs will be productsthat the company's built. And so companies will use AI to increasethe productivity of our employees. And we will use AI to drive and power the products that we sell. Car companies will have two factoriesin the future one factory to build cars, one factory to produce the AI that runs in the car. Well, this is the robotics revolution. So much activity is going around the worldand I can't imagine a better country to lead the roboticsAI revolution than Japan. And the reason for that is, as you know, this country loves robots. You love robots. You have created some of the world's best robots. These are the robots we grew up with. These arethe robots we've loved our whole lives. I didn't even show some of my favorites, Mazinger Z, Gundam. I hope that Japan will take advantageof the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and combinethat with your expertise in mechatronics. No country in the world has greater skills in mechatronics than Japan. This is an extraordinaryopportunity that you must seize. And so I hope that we can work togetherto make that dream possible. NVIDIA AI inJapan is doing incredibly well. We have so many partners here. We have partners that are building large languagemodels. Institute of Science Tokyo, Rakuten, SoftBank Intuitions, NTT, Fujitsu, NEC, Nagoya University, Kotoba Technologies. We also have if you go to the upper right,the AI clouds. AIST, SoftBank, Sakura Internet, GMO Internet Group, HIGHRESO, KDDI, Rutilea, building AI clouds herefor the ecosystem to flourish here in Japan. So many roboticscompanies are starting to understand the capabilities that AI is now providingto take advantage of the opportunity, Yaskawa, Toyota, Kawasaki, Rapyuta. Medical imaging systems— Canon, Fuji Films, Olympus—all taking advantage of AI because in the future, these medicalinstruments will be much more autonomous. It's almost like a nurseAI agent inside the medical instrument, helping the nurse guide the diagnosis. So many different ways, the drugdiscovery industry, so many different ways that AI is being used. And so I'm delighted. I'm delighted by the advancements here. And we want to go even fasterto take advantage of the revolution of AI. Well, this industry is changing. As I said earlier, the computer industryhas fundamentally changed. From coding that runs on CPU to now machine learning running on GPUs. From an industry that produced software, we have now become an industry that is manufacturingartificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligenceis produced in factories. They're running 24/7. When you license software, you install it onto your computer. The manufacturing, the distributionof that software is complete. However, intelligence is never complete. And you're interacting with all of the AIs, whether they're AI agents or AI robots. And the tokens, the intelligence is expressed in tokens,which is the unit of intelligence. It's a number. And these numbers are constituted. These tokens are constituted in waysthat becomes intelligence and words, intelligence in steering wheels,intelligence for self-driving cars, intelligence in motors to articulate human robots, intelligence in proteins and chemicalsand drug discovery. All of these tokens are being producedin these factories, these infrastructure,these factories never existed before. It's a brand new thing, which is the reason why we're seeingso much development around the world. For the very first time, we have a new industry, a new factory producing somethingbrand new, that we call artificial intelligence. These factorieswill be built by companies. They'll be built. Every company will be an AI manufacturer. Of course, no company can afford not to manufacture,produce, artificial intelligence. How can any company affordnot to produce intelligence? How can any country affordnot to produce intelligence? You don't have to produce chips. You don't have to produce software,but you have to produce intelligence. It is vital. It is core to who you are. It is core to who we are. And so we have the new industry, AI factories. And that's the reason why I call it. It's a new industrial revolution. The last time this happenedwas 300 years ago when electricity was discovered,the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricityand a new type of factory was created. And that new factory was a power plant. And then a new industrywas created called energy. Several hundred years ago, there was no such thingas an energy industry. It happenedduring the Industrial Revolution. Now we have a new industry,never existed before. Artificial intelligence sits on top of the computer industry,but it's utilized, it is created by every industry. You have to create your own AI. The drug industry—creates your own AI. The automotive industry—creates your own AI. The robotics industry—creates your own AI. Every industry, every company,every country must produce your own AI. A new industrial revolution. I have a very big announcement to make. Today we're announcing that we're partneringwith SoftBank to bring and to build an AI infrastructure for Japan. Together, we're going to buildJapan's largest AI factory. It's going to be built out of NVIDIA DGX. When it's built, it'll have 25 AI exaflops. Just remember, the largest supercomputer in the world just recently was 1 exaflop. This is 25 exaflops for an AI factory to produce the AI. But in order to distribute the AI,SoftBank is going to integrate NVIDIA's Aerial, which was the engine that I mentioned earlier,running the 5G radio on CUDA. By doing that, we can unify and combine the radio computers, the basebands and the AI computers from 5G-RAN. We can now evolve and reinventthe telecommunications network into AI-RAN. It will be able to carry voice,data, video, but in the future we will also carry AI, a new type, a new type of information: intelligence. This will be distributed across SoftBank's200,000 sites here in Japan, serve 55 million customers. AI factoryand to produce the AI, and AI distributionnetworks to distribute AI-RAN to distribute the AI. We're also going to put on top of it a new type of store, an AI store, so that the AIs that were createdby SoftBank and the AIs created by third parties could be providedto the 55 million customers. So we will build those applications on top of NVIDIA AI enterprise,as I mentioned, showed you before and there will be a new storethat makes AI available to everybody. This is just a magnificent development. What will result is an AI grid that runs across Japan. Now this AI grid will be part of infrastructureand one of the most important infrastructures. Remember, you need factories and roads,part of the infrastructure so that you could just make and distributegoods. You need energy and communications,it's part of the infrastructure. Every time you create somethingfundamentally new for the infrastructure, new industries and new companies are created, new economic opportunities, new prosperity. If not for roads and factories,how would we have the Industrial Revolution? If not for energy and communications, how would we have the IT revolution? Each one of these new infrastructuresopen up new opportunities, and so it's incredibly excitingfor me to partner with SoftBank to make this possible in Japan. Miyakawa-san's team, they should be in the audience. Partnering with you is incredible. And, really, really happythat we're doing this. This is completely revolutionary. This is the first of its kind to transform the telecommunications network,the communications network, into an AI network. Well, let me show you what you can do. There's some amazing things you could do. For example, I'm standing underneath one of the base stations, one of the radio towers, and the car has video, and the car’s video is streamed to the radio tower and the radio tower has AI. This radio tower has video intelligence. It has vision intelligence. So it could see what the car sees and it can understandwhat the car is seeing. That AI model may be too heavyto put inside the car, but it's not too heavy to put in the base station. And using the videothat's streamed to the base station, it can understand anything that'shappening to the car and surrounding. Okay, so this is just one example of using AI at the edge to keep people safe. Or maybe this is the air traffic control, essentially, for self-driving cars. The applications are endless. We can also use this basic concept to turn a whole factory into an AI. This is a factory on this side. Lots of cameras. The cameras are streamed to the base station. And what's amazing is this: because of all the cameras and the AI model in the AI-RAN, now this factory became an AI. You can talk to the factory. Ask the factory, what is happening? Ask the factory, were there any accidents? Is there anything abnormal happening? Was anybody injured today? Could it give you a daily report? You just have to ask the factory, becausethe factory now has turned into an AI. That AI model doesn'thave to run in the factory. That AI model can run in the SoftBank radio. Okay, so that's another example. But the countless examples,you can basically turn every single physical object into an AI, a stadium, a road, a factory,a warehouse, an office, a building. They can all become AIs and you can justtalk to it, just like you can talk to ChatGPT. Okay. What's the condition of the aisles? Any obstruction or spills? You're just talking to the factory. And the factory has observed everything. It understands what it sees. It can reason and it can plan an action or just talk to you. And here it says \"No, the aisles in the warehouse did not have any obstruction, spills or hazards. The conditions of the aisles in the video appears to be well-organized, clean, and free of obstacles or hazards.\" Okay, so you're talking to the factory. It's incredible. You're talking to the warehouse. You're talking to the car. Because all of thesehave now become intelligent. Well, I have a very special guestto talk about our announcement today and also to talk aboutbringing AI to Japan. And this friend of mine,this friend of mine. You might know him. That's the two of us. You might know him. This friend of mine is really,genuinely unique. Where is Masa? Where is Son-san? Is he here? He’s here. Hey! Son-san. Ladies and gentlemen. The great Masa. Great Jensen. Let me let me tell you something. I don't know if you know this. So we've been in, I've been in thetechnology industry a long time. Started in the PC revolution. The computer industry went from PC to Internet, to cloud, to mobile cloud, to AI. Long journey. Masa is the only entrepreneuronly entrepreneur, only innovator in the world that has selected the winner and partnered with the winner, in every single generation. Remember, it was Masa thatbrought Bill Gates to Japan. It was Masa that invented or brought,Jerry Yang to Japan. It was Masa that made it possible for China'scloud industry to happen— Alibaba. It was Masa that brought Steve Jobsto Japan and the iPhone. And maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point Masa was the largest shareholder of NVIDIA. Yes. Oh. It’s okay. We can we can cry. We can cry together. Yeah. Sit down. Sit. How did you do it? How did you pick the innovators, the creators of each one of the technology revolutionsin the history of computing? 100% record. Well, I think I was just lucky. I was born in the right time, and I met with great entrepreneurslike yourself, right? It's a passion. It's a dream. And it's an instinct that you smell, is the real pioneer who is a real, you know, innovator. And, I really think I was lucky, but it's the same visionthat we can smell, right? It's like, wolf smell wolf. I think we smell each other. I have two puppies. I don't like that mental image. No. No. Masa, each, as you think back on the history. Yes.- How is this transition, this platform shift,this revolution, how is this one differentthan the previous ones? How does it feel different to you? Well, I say this is the most exciting,most dynamic, front end of the future. This is 100 times, a thousand times bigger. This is the biggest wave. I thought that's how it feels. Yeah, yeah. I think mathematicallyor from an industrial perspective, the important thing to realizeis that although AI is software,it is a very different type of software. Yeah. The software industry you and I created, and are part of is an industry of tools. It's tools used by humans. Yeah. For the very first time,this new type of software, neural network, Large Language Models, agents, robots are not tools, but they are skills. They're tasks. They do work. - Yeah. They can perform work. And the industry, the market,the industry of work is not $1 trillion, it is $100 trillion. And that's the reason why we realized that this industry is, in fact, not a transition of the IT industry. But this is a transition of every industry.- Yes. Which is the reason why it’s such a big deal. Yeah. Mankind is the only animal that has the super braincompared to any other species. Because of brain power, mankind is so powerful. If you compare just the muscles, lions and the elephants,they have a bigger muscle. But mankind has the smartest brain. And every activity of GDPs today is based onmankind's type of brain activity. So I think every industry will be affected by this revolution. And one of the one of the amazing things,of course, is that, in the industry that is governed by atoms, the size of the industry is limited. Because there's only so much atomsyou can move around. It's heavy. - That's right. But the industry of AIis industry of electrons. Exactly. It's governed by quantum mechanics. Right, right, right. It can be infinitely large. Yeah. And intelligence. Intelligence is so much more valuable compared to just moving things. You know, you think, chain of thought, reasoning. It's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah, Masa one of the things that we announced todaytogether is building the AI grid of Japan. Yeah, yeah. And the AI grid will have AI factoriesfor developing the AI models. It will have AI-RAN distribute the AI models all over Japan. The architecture of theAI factory in the AI-RAN that we worked on togetheris revolutionary. Yeah. The world has nothing like this. Japan will be the world's first. Yeah, every other telco will have to follow thisnew wave. Yeah. And. And so several things thatthat I want to ask you. So one, how would SoftBank use this yourselffor SoftBank and your subsidiaries? And how do you imagine this AI gridwill revolutionize AI here in Japan? Yeah, as you just mentioned our cell towersused to just carry bits for the telecommunication and internetsurfing and so on. However, now with this intelligence network that we densely connect each other, becomes one big neural brain, right? For the infrastructureof intelligence for Japan. That will be amazing. - Yeah. You know, and of course, you could use itfor your subsidiaries like LINE, Yahoo Japan. And PayPay. That's right.- Yeah. And so it will create AIs to make all of your servicesmore enjoyable and more useful to your consumers. But one of the things that I'm very excited about ismaking this resource available so that, so that, researchers and students,startup companies can flourish here in Japan. Yes, definitely. And with your support, we are creating the largest AI data center here in Japan, which, I'm talking with Miyakawa that we should providethis platform to many of those researchers, the students, the startups, so that we, we can encourage with, we are trying to subsidize so thatthey have a better access, much more compute. Yeah. Well, building infrastructureis very capital intensive. And you're making a very big bet on Japan. - Yes. You know that you and I have spokenabout this before. In a lot of ways, Japan technology leddoing the mechatronics era. Yes.- During that industrial revolution when when mechanical technologyelectronics came together. In fact, even consumer electronics, during that age, Japanreally led the world, right? And then when, when theIT industry came and software came, there was a, there was a missthat I think the last three decades, as the software industries flourishedin the West and in China, really, Japan could have beenmore aggressive. Totally agree. Totally. Yeah. And back in those days,even to some extent today, big enterprise, the medias, the big grown up guys, they used to say, 'monozukuri'—meaning, ‘making physical stuff.’ Physical stuff has the real value and the real meaning. And software is something virtualthat they don't trust, the value of software. That has been the mentality for many, many years in Japan that led young, startup guys, the young,you know, generations discouraged, especially after the net bubble crash. Everybody criticized. I was criticized a lot. And that really, you know, was sort oflike a punishment to the young stars. Made, you know, the, depressed feeling. I think we have to revive this passionwhich the robotics is bringing with AI. As you say, you know,bring AI intelligence into robotics. Astro Boy, in Japan, we call ‘Tetsuwan Atomu.’My favorite cartoon. You cannot just have the muscle. It has to have, intelligenceso that the robot can talk. Robot can have a passion,as a friend, you know. I think that kind of, front end challengeis, is very, very needed here. Yeah. Yeah, I think the software era was, is now, The good news is thatthis is the beginning of a new era. Yeah. Reset. Once more, reset. Reset button. That’s right. The industry is in reset. And you could see that the entire stackis being reset because the companies of the last generation arenot doing so well in this new generation. That's right. And so there's an emergence of a wholenew stack, a whole new opportunity. Right. Japan must take advantage.Must take advantage of this time. And artificial intelligence is verydifferent than software. Artificial intelligence requiresthat you have data, that you have domain expertise. Yes. If you are an artist,you have domain expertise, if you develop video games,you have domain expertise. If you look for drugs, you discover drugs,you have domain expertise. If you have domain expertise,you can describe your expertise in data. That data could be used to trainan AI model. That AI model becomesyour artificial intelligence. That's right. At least, Japanese government is not trying to, you know, depress the, this AI revolution. Some of the other countries, they try to be overprotective of the, intelligence, artificial intelligence, so the regulation goes a little crazy. Here in Japan, at least we are lucky that this time Japanese government seems not, you know, trying to,depress, at least no handicap. So I think, but they should encourage more. They should encourage more. As you said, this is the reset. This is the catch up momentfor this new revolution. We can't miss this time. Cannot miss this time. And of course, in order to be partof the AI revolution, you need, this time, you need infrastructure.- Right. This type of software,because it's machine learning. We’re gonna buy a lot of your chips. Well, thank you, thank you. - Yes. And and, you need infrastructure. You need AI factories. Without the infrastructure,it's not possible to create AI. Totally. That's the reason why SoftBank is buildingthe AI grid in Japan. And you will catalyze, you will activate,you’ll turbocharge all of the activity that's here already. We're going to show by our example. Yeah. And hopefully, todaywe have 350 startups in Japan. 350 startups that we work with out of 22,000 in the world. Yeah. It makes no sense. That's right. And so we we must encourage,the young entrepreneurs, the innovators. Yeah, yeah. To jump, to leap, to engage AI. The infrastructure is coming. Yeah. So as I said, Miyakawa and I are discussing, we're going to create the largestAI data center here in Japan. So we are going to provide a lot of encouraging program. Subsidize the compute power, so that they can they can use almost free. Okay, almost free to try out the new models, try out the, you know, whatever, the applications of AI. You should also help with some donation, right? Okay. Hey, Jensen! For some sort of startup, and researchers— This is the last time I'm inviting myself to—Every time I see Masa, it costs me money. Yeah. That's good for everybody. Yes, yes. Yeah. Very happy about that. Masa, what are you most excited aboutfor the future of AI in Japan? What do you hope? What is your dream? Well, look, you know, as you say,I am passionate about, AI robotics. I think the medical solutions, I think medical agents is definitely coming. I think a lot of, new agents. You know, so we have LINE, we have Yahoo and other services, Paypay. We can make many specific AI agents for, for helping Japanese lifestyle. That cannot just come from US, you know,we know about Japanese behaviors, the cutures, the local intelligence and APIs to many, many, sites in Japan. So that I think, agents, I think every—you mentioned about, enterprise AI agents, definitely I support that. I'm excited about that. But also, I think personal agents willreally come to every one of us. Bill gates said, the PC on every desktop. Steve said, a smartphone in every hand. I think now we should say, AI agents to everybody. So each of usshould have our own personal agents. That's right. That will help make our plans for trips,vacations. Right? Education. And it follows you your whole life. Yeah. Yeah. Could you imagine an AI agentthat knows you your whole life? Exactly. Our grandkids, they grow up with, iPhones from, you know, age one, right? They talk, and every timethey see some picture, they do this even with a still picture. Right? Because they are born the,you know, with two fingers, they can they think, you know,every picture can be, blown up. In the future, they'll see a picture,they'll talk to it. Right. They talk. They'll hope it talks back.You can ask it questions. They will have agent, their personal agentssince the age of one and their personal agent, like your,you know, second buddy to see you grow together with you knows everything. You are sick. You know, your health. Your tutor. Yeah. Yeah. Since you were a child. Exactly. Yeah. Remember everything that you read? Remember everything that it taught you,right? That. Yeah. Your personal Aristotle. Totally, totally digital twin. You know? I think that is really coming and having, you know, Japanese domestic knowledge, culture and so on, homegrown agents will have a huge, amazing future. You know, one of the thingsMasa, that countries are awakening to is that the data of their country, their, their citizens' data, encodes the country's knowledge, its culture, its intelligence. And that data belongs to the countrylike its national resources. National security, national security. So that country, every country,should process that data, process and turn it into itsAI for its own people. Totally, totally. Makes no sense to outsourcethat to somebody else. Oh, this is this is very, very important.It's a sovereign data center. Their each sovereign, each country, each governmenthave to migrate, their national security data into their own data center,AI data center. That becomes the, something that you have to havein your own country. Each country have to havenational security, data security. I think that will become, regulated to each protection of each country. Yeah. Every country, every countrywill produce its own intelligence. Of course, every companywill produce their own intelligence. Their own AI. How is it possible that a company, does not create its own AI? Yeah. A company doesn't— It’s like giving your brain away to somebody else. That's right, that's right. And so I think, I think,the world is awakening to this idea. And the most important part is the first part, is that a national grid, an AI grid, has to exist. Right. You cannot have an automotive industryif there are no roads. Totally, totally. You know, and so so now you havebuilt the AI roads for Japan. On top of it, you know, all kinds of new services,new companies can flourish. Totally. So really, really excited about that. Well, Masa-san. Could you imagine if today, you were the largest shareholder. Oh my God. [laughs] Yeah. We tried this. We tried, we tried to. It was three times. Was it three times?I thought it was two times. No, no. The first time, we became yourshareholder by ourselves buying from the market. We talked about the, you know, the... We even talked about. Some things we can share.- Right? You and I had a private talk. I don't want, don't say it. You know, ten years ago—- Oh, I know. I have regretted it. —in my garden. All right. There's nothing. Okay, let me tell you what Masa said. Are you guys ready? So Masa said, “Jensen, the market does notunderstand the value of NVIDIA. Your future is incredible. But the marketdoesn't understand it.� That was ten years ago. “And your journey of suffering will continue for some time.Because you are inventing this future.� “ So, let me give you the money to buy NVIDIA.� He wanted to lend me money to buy NVIDIA. All of it. Now I regret not taking you up on it. That was a great idea. Oh, that was a great idea right? Now, now we're both sad. That was one month after I acquired Arm. Yes, yes. And then we talked aboutcombining the two companies. That was another. Another.That was a good dream too. That was the third one.That was the third attempt. Yeah, right. The first we talked about this privatizing and then second was weI just bought from the market. And then the third time was merging. Three attempts! Oh my god. Well now we are going to we're going to createincredible value together. So NVIDIA and SoftBankare going to partner together. Yeah. The market is so huge! It's incredible. So huge, so huge. And so I am so happy. I'm so happy that that we're doingsomething of this great significance. Yeah. Here in Japan, I, I am very hopeful. Well, this is just the beginning. We're going to do many,many things together. Thank you. And the industry is so big and, you know,Arm has lots of mobile and IoTs and autos. And you have a great datacenters and games and so forth. Many, many things that we can collaborate. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah.Masa-san! Ladies and gentlemen, Son-san. Yeah. Unquestionably one of the great entrepreneursthe world ever seen. No, no. You are the greatest. - Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you. Masa-san. You could seeyou could see his passion for AI. The work, the partnership that we'redeveloping is going to bring an AI grid throughout Japan from the factoryto the distributed AI-RANs. Before I before I leave, I wantto welcome all of you to AI Summit. We have so many sessions here,so many partners here. Our purpose. Our purpose is to partner with you, to bring AI, to activate AI here in Japan, and to use this reset, this opportunity,where technology has reset for us to transform the companies and to create the nextgreat companies here in Japan. Japan has always been dear to me. Most of you do not know that if not for Japan and I mean this very seriously, if not for Japan,NVIDIA would not be here today. And there's a reason for that. If not for Japan,we would have not seen the first AI supercomputer, CUDA supercomputer built. So Japan has been very dear to mefor a very long time. I'm very grateful for our partnership. I'm very grateful for your friendship. And I made a small videoto share with you. Please run it. “If there is a heart in the fish, there is a heart in the water.� Our friendship with Japan began 30 years ago. “Ready? Go!� We had a dream to reinvent 3D graphics. SEGA, with its groundbreaking 3D games, chose NVIDIA to build its next game console. But it became clear our unconventional approach would not live up to our vision. With humility, we asked SEGA’s Irimajiri-San to release us from our obligations. He generously agreed, giving us the time needed to invent the GPU, a chance for success — saving our company. In the years since, we've worked with Japan to redefine gaming on the PlayStation 3, SEGA Arcades, and the Nintendo Switch. And created a medium for telling beautiful stories. With the invention of CUDA, we transitioned from a gaming company to a computing company. As we expanded into the world of Supercomputing and AI, it was Japan's then Tokyo Tech that first saw the promise of GPU accelerated computing. “It’s just the beginning of GPU acceleration becoming mainstream.� Less than a decade after Tsubame, we introduced DGX-1. The AI computer that changed the world. “A GPU is not just a GPU anymore.� NVIDIA and AI are now at the center of a new industrial revolution. From the beginning, Japan has been a friend on the NVIDIA journey. And our story together is just getting started. Thank you, Japan. Have a great AI Summit. Thank you. please welcome Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Applause] Hong hello [Applause] mumai wow it's so great to be here Mumbai so much happening this is as you know India very very dear to the world's computer industry Central to the IT industry at the center at the core of the it of just about every single company in the world my industry your industry that we've built over the last several decades is going through fundamental change seismic change tectonic shifts let's talk about that today but before we start let me thank all of our partners our incredible partners that we're working with here in India to transform the IT industry together and so I'm delighted that all of you have joined us today there are two fundamental shifts that are happening at the same time this hasn't happened since 1964 the year after my birth it wasn't because of my birth but in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced the world to the concept of it the IT industry as we know it introduced the idea of general purpose Computing they described a central processing unit a CPU IO subsystems multitasking the separation of hardware and application software through a layer called the operating system IBM described family compatibility for application so that you could benefit by the install base of your Hardware to run your software over a long period of time they described architectural benefit across Generations so that the investment that you make in software the Investments you make in using the software is not squandered every single time you buy new hardware they recognized in 1964 the importance of in based the importance of software investment the importance of building computers that run the software architecture discipline all described in 1964 I've just described today's computer industry the same industry that the India IT industry was built from general purpose Computing as we know it has existed for 60 years until now for the last 30 years we've had the benefit of mors law an incredible phenomenon without changing the software the hardware can continue to improve in an architecturally compatible way and the benefits of that software doubles every year as a result of doubling in performance every year depending on what your applications you're reducing your cost by a factor of two every single year the most incredible depreciating force of any technology the world's ever known by depreciation cost reduction it made it possible for society to use more and more of it as we continue to consume it as we continue to process more data mors law made it possible for us to continue to drive down cost the critizing Computing as we know it today those two events the invention of the system 360 More's law with Windows PC drove what unquestionably one of the most important industries in the world every single industry has subsequently been built on top of it it but we know now that the scaling of CPUs has reached its limit we can't continue to ride that curve that that free Free Ride The Free Ride of Moors law has ended we have to now do something different or depreciation will end and we now will not enjoy depreciation but experience inflation Computing inflation and that's exactly what's happening around the world we no longer can afford to do nothing in software and expect that our computing experience will continue to improve that cost will decrease and continue to spread the benefits of it and to benefit from solving greater and greater challenges we started our company to accelerate software our vision was there are applications that would benefit from acceleration if we augmented general purpose Computing we take the workload that is very computer intensive and we offload it and we accelerate it using a model we call Cuda a programming model that we invented called cuda that made it possible for us to accelerate applications tremendously that acceleration benefit has the same qualities as mores law for applications that were impossible or impractical to perform using general purpose Computing we have the benefits of accelerated Computing to realize that capability for example computer Graphics real-time computer Graphics was made possible because of Nvidia coming into the world and make possible this new processor we call gpus the GPU was really the first accelerated Computing architecture running Cuda running computer Graphics a perfect example we democratized computer Graphics as we know it 3D Graphics is now literally everywhere it could be used as a medium for almost any application but we felt that longterm accelerated Computing could be far far more impactful and so over the last 30 years we've been on a journey to accelerate one domain of application after another the reason why this has taken so long is simply because of this there is no such magical processor that can accelerate everything in the world because if you could do that you would just call it a CPU you need to reinvent the Computing stack from the algorithms to the architecture underneath and connected to applications on top in one domain after another domain computer Graphics is a beginning but we've taken this architecture Cuda architecture from one industry after another industry after another industry today we accelerate so many important industries ktho is fundamental to semiconductor manufacturing computational lithography simulation computer Aid and Engineering even 5G radios that we've recently announced part Partnerships with that we can accelerate the 5G software stack Quantum Computing so that we can invent the future of computing with classical Quantum hybrid Computing parabricks are Gene sequencing software stack CVS one of the most important things every single company's working on is going from databases to knowledge bases so that we can create AI databases using qvs that we can create and vectorize all of your data qdf data frames data frames is essentially another word for structured data SQL acceleration is possible with qdf in each one of these different libraries we're able to accelerate the application 20 30 50 times of course it takes a rewrite of software which is the reason why it's taken so long in each one of these domains we've had to work with the industry work with our ecosystem software developers and customers in order to accelerate those applications for their domains kopt one of my favorites combinatorial Computing application a very uh Compu intensive application for example the travel salesperson problem every supply chain every driver Rider combination those applications could be accelerated with Coop incredible speed up modulus teaching and AI the laws of physics not just to be able to predict next word but to be able to predict the next moment in time of fluid dynamics and particle physics and so on so forth and of course one of the most famous application libraries we've ever created called cdnn made it possible to democratize artificial intelligence as we know it these acceleration libraries Now cover so many different domains that it appears that accelerated Computing is used everywhere but that's simply because we've applied this architecture one domain after another domain that we've covered just about every single industry now accelerated Computing or Cuda has reached the Tipping Point several years ago about a decade ago something very important happened and most of you have seen the same thing alexnet made a gigantic leap in the performance of computer vision computer vision is a very important field of artificial intelligence Alex net surprised the world with how much of a leap that it was able to produce we had the benefit of taking a step back and asking ourselves what are we witnessing why is alexnet so effective how far can it scale what else can we do with this approach called Deep learning and if we were to find ways to apply deep learning to other problems how does it affect the computer industry and if we wanted to do that if we believe in that future and we're excited about what deep learning can do how would we change every single layer of the Computing stack so that we could reinvent Computing all together 12 years ago we decided to dedicate our entire company to go pursue this Vision it is now 12 years later you every single time I've come to India I've had the benefit of talking to you about deep learning had benefit of talking to you about machine learning and I think it's very very clear now the world has completely changed now let's think about what happened the first thing that happened of course is how we do software our industry is underpinned by the method by which software is done the way that software was done call It software 1.0 program rers would code algorithms we call functions into to run on a computer and we would apply it to input information to predict an output somebody would write python or C or Fortran or Pascal or C++ code algorithms that run on a computer you apply input to it and output is produced very classically the computer model that we understood quite well and it of course created one of the largest Industries in the world right here in India the production of software coding programming became a whole industry this all happened within our generation however that approach of developing software has been disrupted it is now not coding but machine learning using a computer using a computer to study the patterns and relationships of massive amounts of observed data to essentially learn from it the function that predicts it and so we are essentially designing a universal function approximator using machines to learn the expected output that would produce such a function and so going back and forth looking this is software 1.0 with human coding to now software 2.0 using machine learning notice who is writing the software the software is now written by the computer and after you're done training the model you inference the model you then apply that function now as the input that function that large language model that deep learning model that computer vision model speech understanding model is now an input neural network that goes into the GPU that can now make a prediction given new input unobserved input this way of doing software notice is based on fundamentally machine learning and we have gone from coding to machine learning from developing software to creating artificial intelligence and from soft that prefers to run on CPUs to now neural networks that runs best on gpus this at its core is what happened to our industry in the last 10 years we have now seen the complete reinvention of the Computing stack the whole technology stack has been reinvented the hardware the way that software is able is is developed and what software can do is now fundamentally different we dedicated ourselves to advance this field and so this is what we now build what all of you have initially when I first met India we were building gpus that fit into a PCI Express card that goes into your PC this is what a GPU looks like today this is Blackwell incredible system that is designed to study data at an enormous scale yeah thank you a massive system designed to study data at an enormous scale so that we could discover patterns and relationships and learn the meaning of the data this is the Greek breakthrough in the last several years we have now learn the representation or the meaning of words and numbers and images and pixels and videos chemicals proteins amino acids fluid patterns particle physics we have now learned the meaning of so many different types of data we have learned to represent how to represent information in so many different modalities not only have we learned the meaning of it we can translate it to another modality so one great example of course is translating English to Hindi translating English large body of text into other English summarization from pixels to image image recognition from words to pixels image generation from images videos to words captioning from words to proteins used for drug discovery from words to chemicals discovering new compounds from amino acids to proteins understanding the structure of proteins these fundamental ideas essentially a universal translator of information from any modality to another modality has led to a Cambrian explosion of the number of startups in the world they're applying the basic method I just described if I could this and that what else can I do if I can do that and this what else can I do the number of applications has clearly exploded in the last couple two three years the number of generative AI companies around the world tens of thousands tens of billions of dollars have been invested in this field all because of this one instrument that made it possible for us to study data at enormous scales well I just want to say that that in order to build the black wall system of course the Blackwell GPU is involved but it takes seven other chips tsmc manufacture all of these chips and they're just doing an extraordinary job ramping the Blackwell system this is in a all in Blackwell is in full production and we're hoping to uh we're expecting to deliver in volume production in Q4 and so this is basically Blackwell now this is one of the things that's really incredible about about the system let me show it to you nothing's easy this morning this is MV link and it goes across the entire back spine of a rack of gpus and these gpus are all connected from the top to the bottom using MV link driving these incredible cies the world's longest driving CES for copper and it connects uh all of these gpus together 72 dual GPU packages of black WS 144 gpus connected together so it's one giant GPU if I were to spread out all of the chips to show you what this connects together it's essentially a GPU so large it' be like this big but it's obviously impossible to build gpus that large so we break it up into the L the smallest chunks we could which is retical limits and the most Advanced Technologies and we connect it together using MV link this is mvlink backs spine you're looking at all of the gpus being connected that's the quantum switch that connects all of these gpus together on top Spectrum X if you would like to have ethernet and uh what connects this together this is like 50 lbs this I'm just demonstrating how strong I am this is connected to this switch and this is one of the most advanced switches the world's ever built now all of this together represents Blackwell and then it runs the software uh that's on top the Cuda software CNN software uh Megatron for training the large language models tensor RT for doing the inference tensor RT llm for doing uh distributed multi-gpu inference for large language models and then on top of that we have two software Stacks one is NVIDIA AI Enterprise that I'll talk about in a second and then the other is Omniverse I'll talk about both of those in a second this job is surprisingly rigorous so this is the Blackwell system this is what Nvidia builds today those of you who have known us for very long time it's really quite surprising how the company has transformed but literally we reason from first principles how Computing was going to be done in the future and this is Blackwell now the Blackwell system the Blackwell system is extraordinary of course the computation is incredible each rack is 3,000 lb 120 kilowatt Watts 120,000 watts in each rack the density of computing the highest the world's ever known and what we're trying to do is to learn larger and smarter models it's called the scaling law the scaling law comes from the fact that the observation that the empirical observation and measurements that suggests the more data you have to train a large language model with and therefore to correspondingly large model size you know the more information you want to learn from the larger the model has to be or the larger model you would like to train the more data you need to have and each one each year we're increasing the amount of data and the model size each by about a factor of two which means that every single year the computation which is the product of those two has to increase by a factor of four now remember there was a time when the world Mo's law was two times every year and a half or 10 times every 5 years 100 times every 10 years we are now moving technology at a rate of four times every year four times every year over the course of 10 years incredible scaling and we continue to find that AI continues to get smarter as we scale up the uh uh the training size the second thing that we've discovered recently and this is a very big deal after you're done training the model of course uh all of you have used chat GPT when you use chat GPT is a oneshot you ask you give it a prompt instead of writing a program to Compu communicate with a computer today you write a prompt you just talk to the talk to the computer the way you talk to a person you describe the context you describe what it is you're you're querying about uh you could ask it to write a program for you you could you know ask it uh to write a recipe for you whatever question would like to have and the AI process through a very large neural network and produces a sequence of answers producing one one uh one word after another word in the future and starting with strawberry we realize that of course intelligence is not just one shot but intelligence requires thinking and thinking is reasoning and maybe you're doing path planning and maybe you're doing some simulations in your mind you're reflecting on your own answers and so as a result thinking results in higher quality answers and we've now discovered a second scaling law and this is a SCA scaling law at a time of inference the longer you think the higher quality answer you can produce this is not illogical this is very very intuitive to all of us if you were to ask me what's my favorite Indian food I would tell you chicken briani okay and I don't have to think about that very much and I don't have to reason about that I just know it and there are many things that you can ask it like for example what's Nvidia good at Nvidia is good at building AI supercomputers nvidia's uh great at building gpus and those are things that you know that it's encoded into your knowledge however there are many things that requires reasoning you know for example if I had to travel from uh Mumbai to California I I want to do it in the in a way that allows me to enjoy four other cities along the way you know today uh I got here at 3:00 a.m. this morning uh I got here through Denmark I I and right before Denmark I was in Orlando Florida and before Orlando Florida I was in California that was two days ago and I'm still trying to figure out what day we're in right now but anyways I'm happy to be here uh if I were to to tell it I would like to go from California uh to Mumbai uh I would like to do it within uh 3 days uh and I give it all kinds of constraints about what time I'm willing to leave and able to leave what hotels I like to stay at so on so forth uh the people I have to meet the number of permutations of that of course uh quite high and so the planning of that process coming up with a optimal plan is very very complicated and so that's where thinking reasoning planning comes in and the more you compute the higher quality answer uh you could provide and so we now have two fundamental scaling laws that is driving our technology development first for training and now for inference the number of foundation model makers has more than doubled since the beginning of Hopper there are more companies that realize that fundamental intelligence is vital to their company and that they have to build Foundation model technology and second the size of the models have increased by 20 30 40x the amount of computation necessary to train these model because of uh the size of the models but also multimodality capability um reinforcement learning capability synthetic data generation capability the amount of data that we use to train these models has really grown tremendously that's one and then the other reason of course is that Blackwell is also used for generating tokens at incredible speeds and so together all of these factors has led to the demand for Blackwell being incredibly High let's talk about now how we're going to use this technology the headline I thought was really good Nvidia is AI in India now aside from the letter V you could use Nvidia to create the rest of that sentence which I thought was really cool you don't know this story but in 1993 we had to come up with a name for our company and the reason why we chose Nvidia I'll do the extreme short version the reason why I chose Nvidia in the end was because I really love Nvidia being sounds like a mystical Place India Nvidia and sounded like a great place and so if it turns out that computer graphics and accelerated Computing didn't work out for us we could do almost anything and so I'm just happy it worked out okay so so Nvidia in India uh we have we have a really rich ecosystem here uh the first thing that you have to realize is that in order to build an AI ecosystem in any industry or in any country you have to start first with the ecosystem of the infrastructure and we announced that Yoda that ET T Communications and our other partners uh are joining us to build fundamental Computing infrastructure here in India and in just one year's time by the end of this year we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago that's the amount of infrastructure we're y so the first part of building an AI ecosystem is the AI infrastructure just as the first part of uh infrastructure for the internet ecosystem was building the infrastructure of of networking of course uh the infrastructure of networking internet consists of the personal computer cloud and and internet itself um in the case of AI it starts with the AI Computing infrastructure the next part the operating system of AI is large language models and we've worked with Partners here in India to build the Hindi large language model and Hindi large language model as you know there's 25 different um uh formal languages here in in India with apparently um a new a dialect every you know 1,500 kilometers and so so you don't have to go very far before you need to train another model this is the hardest language model region in the world and if anybody could do it you can do it and and once India figures out how to create the Hindi large language model you could you could figure it out for every other country so the next layer is um the application layer above that and uh uh working with us to bring uh AI to uh the ecosystem of India of course uh AI native companies that are creating new applications that are started that made possible only with AI and then our Service Partners uh from from wiipro to infosis to to TCS working with us to take the AI models and the AI infrastructure out to the world's Enterprises now that's Nvidia in India I'm going to have uh Vel our country leader come join me on stage because I would love for him to talk to you about some of the companies that we're working with here in India velle V to par okay so I'm going to intr a couple of other ideas and so earlier I told you that we have Blackwell we have all of the libraries acceleration libraries that we were talking about before but on top there are two very important platforms we working on one of them is called Nvidia AI Enterprise and the other is called Nvidia Omniverse and I'll explain each one of them very Qui quickly first Nvidia AI Enterprise this is a time now where the large language models and the fundamental AI capabilities have reached a level of capabilities were able to now create what is called agents large language models that understand understand the data that of course it's being presented it could be it could be streaming data could video data language model data it could be data of all kinds the first stage is perception the second is reasoning about given its observations uh what is the mission and what is the task it has to perform in order to perform that task the agent would break down the that task into steps of other tasks and uh it would reason about what it would take and it would connect with other AI models some of them are uh good at produ for example understanding PDF maybe it's a model that understands how to generate images maybe it's a model that uh uh is able to retrieve information AI information AI semantic data from a uh proprietary database so each one of these uh large language models models are connected to the central reasoning large language model we call agent and so these agents are able to perform all kinds of tasks uh some of them are maybe uh marketing agents some of them are customer service agents some of them are chip design agents Nvidia has Chip design agents all over our company helping us design chips maybe they're software engineering uh agents uh maybe uh uh maybe they're able to do marketing campaigns uh Supply Chain management and so we're going to have agents that are helping our employees become super employees these agents or agentic AI models uh augment all of our employees to supercharge them make them more productive now when you think about these agents it's really the way you would bring these agents into your company is not unlike the way you would onboard uh someone uh who's a new employee you have to give them training curriculum you have to uh fine-tune them teach them how to use uh how to perform the skills and understand the vocabulary of your of your company uh you evaluate them and so they evaluation systems and you might guardrail them if you're accounting agent uh don't do marketing if you're a marketing agent you know don't report earnings at the end of the quarter so on so forth and so each one of these agents are guardrail um that entire process we put into essentially an agent life cycle Suite of library and we call that Nemo our partners are working with us to integrate these libraries into their platforms so that they could enable agents to be created onboarded deployed improved into a life cycle of agents and so this is what we call Nvidia Nemo we have um on the one hand the libraries on the other hand what comes out of the output of it is a API inference microser service we call Nims essentially this is a factory that builds AIS and Nemo is a suite of libraries that on board and help you operate the AIS and ultimately your goal is to create a whole bunch of Agents we have Partners here that we're working with in India and Vel if you could tell everybody about our ecosystem here absolutely Jensen you know the word that stuck me as I was standing behind was was a word called Mystique this is the Mystique of India Jensen was here exactly 12 months back and he asked me a pretty profound question that the rich tapestry of India how are you going to encode it and it All Began from the infrastructure as mentioned in just 12 months today we have Computing from Yota which has built the stateof thee art y infrastructure tatas are going live E2 e2e has been in existence giving us exceled Computing infrastructure for a long long period of time all this Computing helped us to leave frog to solve one of India's largest problem that is about communication like Jensen said we speak in so many languages he did say 1500 kilm but all of you know every 5050 kilomet we change our dialect we don't only speak English we speak English and if you are from South there'll be a little bit of malali also added into it so how do we make this really work is the work of some of our partners Serum is a classical example serum basically started their efforts to basically help India talk they decided we're going to do voice to voice and and while doing voice to voice they had to understand how does this language work which is multimodal how do we make sure that it performs and they came into existence pretty quickly because there was infrastructure that was available to us similarly we saw projects coming from bhat GPT again a work that has been done predominantly in Academia the Academia in India has been rich with ideas and every time they wanted an idea to be translated into reality they need infrastructure today the work that we are doing in iits the work that we are doing at different organization is all a result of coming together solving the critical issue that India Has Not only was the language getting solved we also realized very quickly that there are many mega challenges that India has no one loves India more than Michelle a well spoken Indian and a healthy Indian always make a difference and that's why we have companies who've been working on health as many of us know it's been challenging how do we look after our health but Diagnostics coming from s Tuple cure. is really helping us solve many of these challenges so with that promise Jensen that's awesome healthy yeah and well spoken healthy and well spoken and the the important thing here that the uh it takes an entire ecosystem of Partners to be able to help the world apply AI to help their employees be more productive and this is whereas India was focused on it the back office operations of software the delivery of software producing software the next generation of it is going to be about producing and delivery of AI and as you know the delivery of software coding and the delivery of AI is fundamentally different but dramatically more impactful insanely more exciting and the ability for this industry for India to help every single company around the world to enjoy the benefit of Agents to enjoy the benefits of AIS across all of their different functionalities to be able to deploy it at scale I don't know anybody else who could do it this is just an extraordinary opportunity our job is to help you build Ai and deploy AI your job is to take these libraries and the capabilities that we have combine it with your incredible it capability software capabilities so that we can create agents and help every single company benefit from it and so this is the first part the second part is this what happens after agents now remember every single company has employees but most companies the goal is to build something to produce something to make something and that those things that people make could be factories it could be warehouses it could be cars and planes and trains and uh ship ships and so on and so forth all kinds of things computers and servers the servers that Nvidia builds it could be phones most companies in the largest of Industries ultimately produces something sometimes produce production of service which is the IT industry but many of your customers are about producing something those that next generation of AI needs to understand the physical world we call it physical AI in order to create physical AI we need three computers and we created three computers to do so the dgx computer which Blackwell for example is is a reference design an architecture for to create things like dgx computers for training the model that model needs a place to be refined it needs a place to learn it needs the place to apply its physical capability it's robotics capability we call that Omniverse a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics where robots can learn to be robots and then when you're done with the training of it that AI model could then run in the actual robotic system that robotic system could be a car it could be a robot it could be AV it could be a autonomous moving robot it could be a a picking arm uh it could be an entire Factory or an entire Warehouse that's robotic and that computer we call agx Jetson agx dgx for training and then Omniverse for doing the digital twin now here here in India we've got a really great ecosystem who is working with us to take this infrastructure take this ecosystem of capabilities to help the world build physical AI systems and you know what I've really loved is adorb is one of the largest robotics company they build Robotics and more importantly they put it in a digital twin where optimization takes place they teach the robo all the inputs that comes out of the physical world not only is that work taking place our system integrators asenta TCS Tech Mahindra are taking that knowledge not only into India but also outside India so do it in India for India and do from India for globe start locally grow globally right right that's fantastic okay thank you thank you thank you very much Michelle thank you thank you we made a short video to help you put everything together that I just said run it please for 60 years software 1.0 code written by programmers ran on general purpose CPUs then software 2.0 arrived machine learning neural networks running on gpus this led to the Big Bang of generative AI models that learn and generate anything today generative AI is revolutionizing $100 trillion in Industries knowledge Enterprises use agentic AI to automate digital work hello I'm James a digital human Industrial Enterprises use physical AI to automate physical work physical AI embodies robots like self-driving cars that safely navigate the real world manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks and humanoid robots who work collaboratively alongside us plants and factories will be embodied by physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operations or speaking to us Nvidia builds three computers to enable developers to create physical AI the models are first trained on dgx then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcement learning physics feedback in Omniverse and the trained AI runs on Nvidia Jetson agx robotics computers Nvidia Omniverse is a physics-based operating system for physical AI simulation robots learn and fine-tune their skills in Isaac lab a robot gym built on Omniverse this is just one robot future factories will orchestrate teams of robots and monitor entire operations through thousands of sensors for factory digital digal twins they use an Omniverse blueprint called Mega with mega the factory digital twin is populated with virtual robots and their AI models the robots brains the robots execute a task by perceiving their environment reasoning planning their next motion and finally converting it to actions these actions are simulated in the environment by the world simulator in Omniverse and the results are perceived by the robot brains through Omniverse sensor simulation based on the sensor simulations the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and position of everything in the factory digital twin this software in the loop testing brings softwar defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments letting Industrial Enterprises simulate and validate changes in an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world saving massive risk and cost the era of physical AI is here transforming the world's heavy Industries and Robotics [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music]

we'll start at the top examples of the use cases and then seeing it in action that's kind of the flow in such your compelling story I'm super nervous about this just got to get in the Rhythm we're 2 weeks away from you guys can go really really make it bre we should take a swing at it yeah that's the plan we need to get daily status on that animation can you mute cuz I hear myself sorry what's the drop date for all the videos it needs to be done on the 28th did you get all that safe travels everybody super excited to see everyone see you guys soon okay bye we're basically moving as fast as the world can absorb technology so we've got to LEAP from ourselves [Music] in now the spine you just have to figure out a way to make it pop you know what I'm [Music] saying you know what I'm saying you want to yeah that kind of thing [Music] okay thank you I'm super late let's [Music] go please welcome welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Music] W I am very happy to be back thank you NTU for letting us use your Stadium the last time I was here I received a degree from [Applause] n and I gave the Run don't walk speech and today we have a lot to cover so I cannot walk I must run we have a lot to cover I have many things to tell you I'm very happy to be here in Taiwan Taiwan is the home of our treasured Partners this is in fact where everything Nvidia does begins our partners and ourselves take it to the world Taiwan and our partnership has created the world's AI infrastructure today I want to talk to you about several things one what is happening and the meaning of the work that we do together what is generative AI what is its impact on our industry and on every industry a blueprint for how we will go forward and engage this incredible opportunity and what's coming next generative Ai and its impact our blueprint and what comes next these are really really exciting times a restart of our computer industry an industry that you have forged an IND industry that you have created and now you're prepared for the next major Journey but before we start Nvidia lives at the intersection of computer graphics simulations and artificial intelligence this is our soul everything that I show you today is simulation it's math it's science it's computer science it's amazing computer architecture none of it's animated and it's all homemade this is invidious soul and we put it all into this virtual world we called Omniverse please enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] when doubt [Applause] I want to speak to you in Chinese but I have so much to tell you I have to think too hard to speak Chinese so I have to speak to you in English at the foundation of everything that you saw was two fundamental Technologies accelerated Computing and artificial intelligence running inside the Omniverse those two technologies those two fundamental forces of computing are going to reshape the computer industry the computer industry is now some 60 years old in a lot of ways everything that we do today was invented the year after my birth in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced central processing units general purpose Computing the separation of hardware and software through an operating system multitasking IO subsystems dma all kinds of technologies that we use today architectural compatibility backwards compa ibility family compatibility all of the things that we know today about Computing largely described in 1964 of course the PC Revolution democratized Computing and put it in the hands and the houses of everybody and then off in 2007 the iPhone introduced mobile Computing and put the computer in our pocket ever since everything is connected and running all the time through the mobile cloud this last 60 years we saw several just several not that many actually two or three major technology shifts two or three tectonic shifts in Computing where everything changed and we're about to see that happen again there are two fundamental things that are happening the first is that the processor the engine by which the computer industry runs on the central processing unit the performance scaling has slowed tremendously and yet the amount of computation we have to do is still doubling very quickly exponentially if processing requirement if the data that is that we need to process continues to scale exponentially but performance does not we will experience computation inflation and in fact we're seeing that right now as we speak the amount of data center power that's used all over the world is growing quite substantially the cost of computing is growing we are seeing computation inflation this of course cannot continue the data is going to continue to increase exponentially and CPU performance scaling will never return there is a better way for almost two decades now we've been working on accelerated Computing Cuda augments a CPU offloads and accelerates the work that A specialized processor can do much much better in fact the performance is so extraordinary that it is very clear now as CPU scaling has slowed and event substantially stopped we should accelerate everything I predict that every application that is processing intensive will be accelerated and surely every data center will be accelerated the near future now accelerated Computing is very sensible it's very common sense if you take a look at an application and here the 100t means 100 units of time it could be 100 seconds it could be 100 hours and in many cases as you know we're now working on artificial intelligence applications that run for a 100 days the ont is code that is requires sequential processing where single-threaded CPUs are really quite essential operating systems control logic really essential to have one instruction executed after another instruction however there are many algorithms computer Graphics is one that you can operate completely in parallel computer Graphics image processing physics simulations combinatorial optimizations graph processing database processing and of course the very famous linear algebra of deep learning there are many types of algorithms that are very conducive to acceleration through parallel processing so we invented an architecture to to do that by adding the GPU to the CPU the specialized processor can take something that takes a great deal of time and accelerate it down to something that is in incredibly fast and because the two processors can work side by side they're both autonomous and they're both separate independent that is we could accelerate what used to take a 100 units of time down to one unit of time well the speed up is incredible it almost sounds unbelievable it almost sounds unbelievable but today I'll demonstrate many examples for you the benefit is quite extraordinary a 100 times speed up but you only increase the power by about a factor of three and you increase the cost by only about 50% we do this all the time in the PC industry we add a GPU a $500 GPU gForce GPU to a $1,000 PC and the performance increases tremendously we do this in a data center a billion dooll data center we add $500 million worth of gpus and all of a sudden it becomes an AI Factory this is happening all over the world today well the savings are quite extraordinary you're getting 60 times performance per dollar a 100 times speed up you only increase your power by 3x 100 times speed up you only increase inre your cost by 1.5x the savings are incredible the savings are measured in dollars it is very clear that many many companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars processing data in the cloud if it was accelerated it is not unexpected that you could save hundreds of millions of dollars now why is that well the reason for that is very clear we've been experiencing inflation for so long in general purpose Computing now that we finally came to we finally determined to accelerate there's an enormous amount of captured loss that we can now regain a great deal of captured retained waste that we can now relieve out of the system and that will translate into savings Savings in money Savings in energy and that's the reason why you've heard me say the more you buy the more you save and now I've shown you the mathematics it is not accurate but it is correct okay that's called CEO math CEO math is not accurate but it is correct the more you buy the more you save well accelerated computing does deliver extraordinary results but it is not easy why is it that it saves so much money but people haven't done it for so long the reason for that is because it's incredibly hard there is no such thing as a software that you can just run through a c compiler and all of a sudden that application runs a 100 times faster that is not even logical if it was possible to do that they would have just changed the CPU to do that you in fact have to rewrite the software that's the hard part the software has to be completely Rewritten so that you could reactor reexpress the algorithms that was written on a CPU so that it could be accelerated offloaded accelerated and run in parallel that computer science exercise is insanely hard well we've made it easy for the world over the last 20 years of course the very famous cdnn the Deep learning library that processes neural networks we have a library for AI physics that you could use for fluid dynamics and many other applications where the neural network has to obey the laws of physics we have a great new library called aerial that is a Cuda accelerated 5G radio so that we can software Define and accelerate the Telecommunications networks the way that we've soft software defined the world world's networking um uh internet and so the ability for us to accelerate that allows us to turn all of Telecom into essentially the same type of platform a Computing platform just like we have in the cloud kitho is a comp computational lithography platform that allows us to uh process the most computationally intensive parts of Chip manufacturing making the mask tsmc is in the process of going to production with k litho saving enormous amounts of energy and more enormous amounts of money but the goal for tsmc is to accelerate their stack so that they're prepared for even further advances in algorithm and more computation for deeper and deeper uh narrow and narrow transistors parab brakes is our Gene sequencing Library it is the highest throughput library in the world for Gene sequencing coopt is an incredible library for combinatorial optimization route planning optimization the traveling salesman problem incredibly complicated people do people have well scientists have largely concluded that you needed a quantum computer to do that we created an algorithm that runs on accelerated Computing that runs Lightning Fast 23 World Records we hold every single major world record today C Quantum is an emulation system for a quantum computer if you want to design a quantum computer comp you need a simulator to do so if you want to design Quantum algorithms you need a Quantum emulator to do so how would you do that how would you design these quantum computers create these Quantum algorithms if the quantum computer doesn't exist while you use the fastest computer in the world that exist today and we call it of course Nvidia Cuda and on that we have an emulator that simulates quantum computers it is used by several hundred thousand researchers around the world it is integrated into all the leading M leading Frameworks for Quantum Computing and is used in scientific super super Computing centers all over the world kdf is an unbelievable library for data processing data processing consumes the vast majority of cloud spend today all of it should be accelerated qdf accelerates the major libraries used in the world spark many of you probably use spark in your companies pandas um a new one called polar and of course uh networkx which is a graph processing graph processing uh database um library and so these are just some examples there are so many more each one of them had to be created so that we can enable the ecosystem to take advantage of accelerated Computing if we hadn't created cudnn Cuda alone wouldn't have been able wouldn't have been possible for of the deep learning scientists around the world to use because Cuda and the algorithms that are used in tensor flow and Pi torch the Deep learning algorithms the separation is too far apart it's almost like trying to do computer Graphics without open G it's almost like doing data processing without SQL these domain specific libraries are really The Treasure of our company we have 350 of them the these libraries Is What It Takes and what has made it possible for us to have such open so many markets I'll show you some other examples today well just last week Google announced that theyve put CDF in the cloud and accelerate pandas pandas is the most popular data science library in the world many of you in here probably already use pandas it's used by 10 million data scientists in the world downloaded 170 million times each month it is the Excel that is the spreadsheet of data scientists well with just one click you can now use pandas in C collab which is Google's cloud data centers platform accelerated by CDF the speed up is really incredible let's take a look [Music] that was a great demo right didn't take [Applause] long when you accelerate data processing that fast demos don't take long okay well Cuda has now achieved what people call a Tipping Point but it's even better than that Cuda has now achieved a virtuous cycle this rarely happens if you look at history and all the Computing architecture Computing Platforms in the case of microprocessor CPUs it has been here for 60 years it has not been changed for 60 years at this level this way of doing Computing accelerated Computing has been around has creating a new platform is extremely hard because it's a chicken and egg problem if there are no developers that use your platform then of course there will be no users but if there are no users there are no install base if they're no install base developers aren't interested in it developers want to write software for a large install base but a large install base requires a lot of applications so that users would create that install base this chicken or the egg problem has rarely been broken and has taken us now 20 years one domain Library after another one acceleration Library another and now we have 5 million developers around the world we serve every single industry from Health Care Financial Services of course the computer industry automotive industry just about every major industry in the world just about every field of science because there are so many customers for our architecture oems and cloud service providers are interested in building our systems system makers am amazing system makers like the ones here in Taiwan are interested in building our systems which then takes and offers more systems to the market which of course creates greater opportunity for us which allows us to increase our scale R&D scale which speeds up the application even more well every single time we speed up the application the cost of computing goes down this is that slide I was showing you earlier 100x speed up translates to 97 96% 98% savings and so when we go from 100x speed up to 200x speed up to a000 X speed up the savings the marginal cost of computing continues to fall well of course we believe that by reducing the cost of computing incredibly the market developers scientists inventors will continue to discover new algorithms that cons consume more and more and more Computing so that one day something happens that a pH shift happens that the marginal cost of computing is so low that a new way of using computers emerge in fact that's what we're seeing now over the years we have driven down the marginal cost of computing in the last 10 years in one particular algorithm by a million times well as a result it is now very logical and very common sense to train large language models with all of the data on the internet nobody thinks twice this idea that you could create a computer that could process so much data to write its own software the emergence of artificial intelligence was made possible because of this complete belief that if we made Computing cheaper and cheaper and cheaper somebody's going to find a great use well today Cuda has achieved the virtual cycle install base is growing Computing cost is coming down which causes more developers to come up with more ideas which drives more demand and now we're on in the beginning of something very very important but before I show you that I want to show you what is not possible if not for the fact that we created Cuda that we created the modern version of General the modern Big Bang of AI generative AI what I'm about to show you would not be possible this is Earth two the idea that we would create a digital twin of the earth that we would go and simulate the Earth so that we could predict the future of our planet to better Aver disasters or better understand the impact of climate change so that we can adapt better so that we could change our habits now this digital twin of Earth is probably one of the most ambitious projects that the world's ever undertaken and we're taking step large steps every single year and I'll show you results every single year but this year we made some great breakthroughs let's take a look on Monday the storm will Veer North again and approach Taiwan there are big uncertainties regarding its path different paths will have different levels of impact on Taiwan forvia Earth [Music] [Music] 2f [Music] for fore cordi AI [Music] Nvidia [Music] [Music] [Applause] someday in the near future we will have continuous weather prediction at every at every Square kilometer on the planet you will always know what the climate's going to be you will always know and this will run continuously because we trained the AI and the AI requires so little energy and so this is just an incredible achievement I hope you you enjoyed it and very importantly uh what [Applause] the truth is that was a Jensen AI that was not me I I wrote I wrote it but an AI Jens AI had to say it because of our dedication to continuously improve the performance of Drive the cost down researchers discover discovered AI researchers discovered Cuda in 2012 that was nvidia's first contact with AI this was a very important day we had the good wisdom to work with the the scientists to make it possible for a deep learning to happen and Alex net achieved of course a tremendous computer vision breakthrough but the great wisdom was to take a step back and understanding what was the background what is the foundation of deep learning what is its long-term impact what is its potential and we realized that this technology has great potential to scale an algorithm that was invented and discovered decades ago all of a sudden because of more data larger networks and very importantly a lot more compute all of a sudden deep learning was able to achieve what no human algorithm was able to now imagine if we were to scale up the architecture even more larger networks more data and more compute what could be possible so we dedicated ourselves to reinvent everything after 2012 we changed the architecture of our GPU to add tensor course we invented MV link that was 10 years ago now CNN tensor RT nickel we bought melanox tensor RT LM the Triton inference server and all of it came together on a brand new computer nobody understood nobody asked for it nobody understood it and in fact I was certain nobody wanted to buy it and so we announced it at GTC and open AI a small company in San Francisco saw it and they asked me to deliver one to them I delivered the first dgx the F the world's first AI supercomputer to open AI in 2016 well after that we continued to scale from one AI supercomputer one AI Appliance we scaled it up to large supercomputers even larger by 2017 the world discovered Transformers so that we could train enormous amounts of data and recognize and learn patterns that are sequential over large spans of time it is now possible for for us to train these large language models to understand and achieve a breakthrough in natural language understanding and we kept going after that we built even larger ones and then in November 2022 trained on thousands tens of thousands of Nvidia gpus in a very large AI supercomputer open AI announced chat GPT 1 million users after five days 1 million after five days a 100 million after two months the fastest growing application in history and the reason for that is very simple it is just so easy to use and it was so magical to use to be able to interact with computer like it's Human Instead of being clear about what you want it's like the computer understands your meaning it understands your intention oh I think here it it um asked the the closest Night Market night as you know U the night market is very important to me so when I was young uh I was I think I was four and a half years old I used to love going to the night mark Market because I I just love watching people and and uh uh and so we went my parents used to take us to the night market uh and and um uh and I love I love U I love going and one day uh my face you guys might might see that I have a large scar on my face my face was cut because somebody was washing their knife and I was a little kid um but my memories of of the Night Market is uh so deep because of that and I used to love I I just I still love going to the night market and I just need to tell you guys this the the Tona Night Market is is really good because there's a lady uh she's been working there for 43 years she's the fruit lady and it's in the middle of the stre the middle between the two go find her okay she [Applause] she's really terrific I think it would be funny after this all of you go to see her she every year she's doing better and better her cart has improved and yeah I just love watching her succeed anyways anyways uh Chad GPT came along and um and something is very important in this slide here let me show you something this slide okay and this Slide the fundamental difference is this until chat GPT revealed it to the world AI was all about perception natural language understanding Compu computer vision speech recognition it's all about perception and detection this was the first time the world saw a generative AI It produced tokens one token at a time and those tokens were words some of the tokens of course could now be images or charts or tables songs words speech videos those tokens could be anything they anything that that you can learn the meaning of it could be tokens of chemicals tokens of proteins genes you saw earlier in Earth 2 we were generating tokens of the weather we can we can learn physics if you can learn physics you could teach an AI model physics the AI model could learn the meaning of physics and it can generate physics we were scaling down to 1 kilometer not by using filtering it was generating and so we can use this method to generate tokens for almost anything almost anything of value we can generate steering wheel control for a car we can generate articulation for a robotic arm everything that we can learn we can now generate we have now arrived not at the AI era but a generative AI era but what's really important is this this computer that started out as a supercomputer has now evolved into a Data Center and it produces one thing it produces tokens it's an AI Factory this AI Factory is generating creating producing something of Great Value a new commodity in the late 1890s Nicola Tesla invented an AC generator we invented an AI generator the AC generator generated electrons nvidia's AI generator generates tokens both of these things have large Market opportunities it's completely fungible in almost every industry and that's why it's a new Industrial Revolution we have now a new Factory producing a new commodity for every industry that is of extraordinary value and the methodology for doing this is quite scalable and the methodology of doing this is quite repeatable notice how quickly so many different AI models generative AI models are being invented literally daily every single industry is now piling on for the very first time the IT industry which is $3 trillion $3 trillion IT industry is about to create something that can directly serve a hundred trillion dollar of Industry no longer just an instrument for information storage or data processing but a factory for generating intelligence for every industry this is going to be a manufacturing industry not a manufacturing industry of computers but using the computers in manufacturing this has never happened before quite an extraordinary thing what led started with accelerated comp Computing led to AI led to generative Ai and now an industrial revolution now the impact to our industry is also quite significant of course we could create a new commodity a new product we call tokens for many Industries but the impact of ours is also quite profound for the very first time as I was saying earlier in 60 years every single layer of computing has been changed from CPUs general purpose Computing to accelerated GPU Computing where the computer needs instructions now computers process llms large language models AI models and whereas the Computing model of the past is retrieval based almost every time you touch your phone some pre-recorded text or pre-recorded image or pre-recorded video is retrieved for you and recomposed based on a recommender system to present it to you based on your habits but in the future your computer will generate as much as possible retrieve only what's necessary and the reason for that is because generated generated data requires less energy to go fetch information generated data also is more contextually relevant it will encode knowledge it will your understanding of you and instead of get that inform information for me or get that file for me you just say ask me for an answer and instead of a tool instead of your computer being a tool that we use the computer will now generate skills it performs tasks and instead of an industry that is producing software was which was a revolu evolutionary idea in the early 90s remember the idea that Microsoft created for packaging software revolutionize the PC industry without packaged software what would we use the PC to do it drove this industry and now we have a new Factory a new computer and what we will run on top of this is a new type of software and we call it Nims Nvidia inference microservices now what what happens is the Nim runs inside this Factory and this Nim is a pre-trained model it's an AI well this AI is of course quite complex in itself but the the Computing stack that runs AIS are insanely complex when you go and use chat GPT underneath their stack is a whole bunch of software underneath that prompt is a ton of software and it's incredibly complex because the models are large billions to trillions of parameters it doesn't run on just one computer it runs on multiple computers it has to distribute the workload across multiple gpus tensor parallelism pipeline parallelism data parallel all kinds of parallelism expert parallelism all kinds of parallelism Distributing the workload across multiple gpus processing it as fast as possible because if you are in a factory if you run a factory your throughput directly correlates to your revenues your throughput directly correlates to quality of service and your throughput directly correlates to number of people who can use your service we are now in a world where data center throughput utilization is vitally important it was important in the past but not Vally important it was important in the past but people don't measure it today every par parameter is measured start time uptime utilization throughput idle time you name it because it's a factory when something is a factory its operations directly correlate to the financial performance of the company and so we realized that this is incredibly complex for most companies to do so what we did was we created this AI in a box and it containers an incredible amounts of software inside this container is Cuda cudnn tensor RT Triton for inference Services it is cloud native so that you could Auto scale in a kubernetes environment it has Management Services and hooks so that you can monitor your AIS it has common apis standard apis so that you could literally chat with this box you download this Nim and you can talk to it so long as you have Cuda on your computer which is now of course everywhere it's in every cloud available from every computer maker it is available in hundreds of millions of PCS when you download this you have an AI and you can chat with it like chat GPT all of the software is now integrated 400 dependencies all integrated into one we tested this Nim each one of these pre-trained models against all kind are Tire install base that's in the cloud all the different versions of Pascal and ampers and Hoppers and all kinds of different versions I even forget some Nims incredible invention this is one of my favorites and of course as you know we now have the ability to create large language models and pre-trained models of all kinds and we we have all of these various versions whether it's language based or Vision based or Imaging based or we have versions that are available for healthc care digital biology we have versions that are digital humans that I'll talk to you about and the way you use this just come to ai. nvidia.com and today we uh just posted up in hugging face the Llama 3 Nim fully optimized it's available there for you to try and you can even take it with you it's available to you for free and so you could run it in the cloud run it in any Cloud you could download this container put it into your own Data Center and you could host it make it available for your customers we have as I mentioned all kinds of different domains physics some of it is for semantic retrieval called Rags Vision languages all kinds of different languages and the way that you use it is connecting these microservices into large applications one of the most important applications in the coming future of course is customer service agents customer service agents are necessary in just about every single industry it represents trillions of dollars of of customer service around the world nurses are customer service agents um in some ways some of them are nonprescription or or non Diagnostics um based nurses are essentially customer service uh customer service for retail for uh Quick Service Foods Financial Services Insurance just tens and tens of millions of customer service can now be augmented by language models and augumented by Ai and so these one these boxes that you see are basically Nims some of the NIMS are reasoning agents given a task figure out what the miss is break it down into a plan some of the NIMS retrieve information some of the NIMS might uh uh uh go and do search some of the NIMS uh might use a tool like kuop that I was talking about earlier they could use a tool that uh could be running on sap and so it has to learn a particular uh language called abap maybe some Nims have to uh uh do SQL queries and so all of these Nims are experts that are now assembled as a team so what's happening the application layer has been changed what used to be applications written with instructions are now applications that are assembling teams assembling teams of AIS very few people know how to write programs almost everybody knows how to break down a problem and assemble teams very every company I believe in the future will have a large collection of Nims and you would bring down the experts that you want you connect them into a team and you you don't even have to figure out exactly how to connect them you just give the mission to an agent to a Nim to figure out who to break the task down and who to give it to and they that a that Central the leader of the of the application if you will the leader of the team would break down the task and give it to the various team members the team members would do their perform their task bring it back to the team leader the team leader would reason about that and present an information back to you just like humans this is in our near future this is the way applications are going to look now of course we could interact with these large these AI services with text prompts and speech prompts however there are many applications where we would like to interact with what what is otherwise a humanlike form we call them digital humans Nvidia has been working on digital human technology for some time let me show it to you and well before I do that hang on a second before I do that okay digital humans has the potential of being a great interact Interactive with you they make much more engaging they could be much more empathetic and of course um we have to uh uh cross this incredible Chasm this uncanny Chasm of realism so that the digital humans would appear much more natural this is of course our vision this is a vision of where we love to go uh but let me show you where we are great to be in Taiwan before I head out to the night market let's dive into some exciting frontiers of digital humans imagine a future where computers interact with us just like humans can hi my name is Sophie and I am a digital human brand ambassador for Unique this is the incredible reality of digital humans digital humans will revolutionize industries from customer service to advertising and ging the possibilities for digital humans are endless using the scans you took of your current kitchen with your phone they will be AI interior designers helping generate beautiful photorealistic suggestions and sourcing the materials and Furniture we have generated several design options for you to choose from they'll also be AI customer service agents making the interaction more engaging and personalized or digital healthcare workers who will check on patients providing Timely personalized care um I did forget to mention to the doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications the antibiotics you've been prescribed cicin and metronidazol don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them and they'll even be AI brand ambassadors setting the next marketing and advertising Trends hi I'm EMA Japan's first virtual model new breakthroughs in generative Ai and computer Graphics let digital humans see understand and interact with us in humanlike ways H from what I can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup the foundation of digital humans are AI models built on multilingual speech recognition and synthesis and llms that understand and generate conversation the AIS connect to another generative AI to dynamically animate a lifelike 3D mesh of a face and finally AI models that reproduce lifelike appearances enabling real-time path traced subsurface scattering to simulate the way light penetrates the skin scatters and exits at various points giving skin its soft and translucent appearance Nvidia Ace is a suite of digital human Technologies packaged as easy to deploy fully optimized microservices or Nims developers can integrate Ace Nims into their existing Frameworks engines and digital human experiences neotron slm and llm Nims to understand our intent and orchestrate other models Reva speech Nims for interactive speech and translation audio to face and gesture Nims for facial and body animation an Omniverse RTX with dlss for neuro rendering of skin and hair Ace Nims run on Nvidia gdn a Global Network of Nvidia accelerated infrastructure that delivers low latency digital human processing to over 100 regions Kaa [Applause] pretty incredible well those those Ace runs in a cloud but it also runs on PCS we had the good wisdom of including tensor core gpus in all of RTX so we've been shipping AI gpus for some time preparing ourselves for this day the reason for that is very simple we always knew that in order to create a new Computing platform you need to install Bas first eventually the application will come if you don't create the install base how could the application come and so if you build it they might not come but if you build it if you don't build it they cannot come and so we installed every single RTX GPU with tensor core G tensor core processing and now we have 100 million GeForce RTX AIP PCS in the world and we're shipping 200 and this this compy Tex wor featuring four new amazing laptops all of them are able to run AI your future laptop your future PC will become an AI it'll be constantly helping you assisting you in the background the PC will also run applications that are enhanced by AI of course all your photo editing and your writing and your tools all the things that you use will all be enhanced by Ai and your PC will also host applications with digital humans that are AIS and so there are different ways that AIS will manifest themselves and become used in PCS but PCS will become very important AI platform and so where do we go from here I spoke earlier about the scaling of our data centers and every single time we scaled we found a new phase change when we scaled from dgx into large AI supercomputers we enabled Transformers to be able to train on enormously large data data sets well what happened was in the beginning the data was human supervised it required human labeling to train AIS unfortunately there is only so much you can human label Transformers made it possible for unsupervised learning to happen now Transformers just look at an enormous amount of data or look at enormous amount of video or look at enormous amount of uh images and it can learn from studying an enormous amount of data find the patterns and relationships itself while the next generation of AI needs to be physically based most of the AIS today uh don't understand the laws of physics it's not grounded in the physical world in order for us to generate uh uh images and videos and 3D graphics and many physics phenomenons we need AIS that are physically based and understand the laws of physics well the way that you could do that is of course learning from video is One Source another way is synthetic data simulation data and another way is using computers to learn with each other this is really no different than using alphao having alphao play itself selfplay and between the two capabilities same capabilities playing each other for a very long period of time they emerge even smarter and so you're going to start to see this type of AI emerging well if the AI data is synthetically generated and using reinforcement learning it stands to reason that the rate of data generation will continue to advance and every single time data generation grows the amount of computation that we have to offer needs to grow with it we are about to enter a phase where AIS can learn the laws of physics and understand and be grounded in physical world data and so we expect that models will continue to grow and we need larger gpus well Blackwell was designed for this generation this is Blackwell and has several very important Technologies uh one of course is just the size of the chip we took two of the largest a chip that is as large as you can make it at tsmc and we connected two of them together with a 10 terabytes per second link between the world's most advanced cies connecting these two together we then put two of them on a computer node connected with a gray CPU the gray CPU could be used for several things in the training situation it could use it could be used for fast checkpoint and restart in the case of inference and generation could be used for storing context memory so that the AI has memory and understands uh the context of the the conversation you would like to have it's our second generation Transformer engine Transformer engine allows us to adapt dynamically to a lower precision based on the Precision and the range necessary for that layer of computation uh this is our second generation GPU that has secure AI so that you could you could ask your service provider to protect your AI from being either stolen from theft or tampering this is our fifth generation MV link MV link allows us to connect multiple gpus together and I'll show you more of that in a second and this is also our first generation with a reliability and availability engine this system this Ras system allows us to test every single transistor flip-flop memory on chip memory off chip so that we can in the field determine whether a particular chip is uh failing the mtbf the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 10,000 gpus is a measured in hours the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 100,000 gpus is measured in minutes and so the ability for a supercomputer to run for a long period of time and train a model that could last for several months is practically impossible if we don't invent Technologies to enhance its reliability reliability would of course enhance its uptime which directly affects the cost and then lastly decompression engine data processing is one of the most important things we have to do we added a data compression engine decompression engine so that we can pull data out of storage 20 times faster than what's possible today well all of this repres presents Blackwell and I think we have one here that's in production during GTC I showed you Blackwell in a prototype State um the other side this is why we practice [Laughter] ladies and gentlemen this is Blackwell black Blackwell is in production incredible amounts of Technology this is our production board this is the most complex highest performance computer the world's ever made this is the great CPU and these are you could see each one of these blackw dieses two of them connected together you see that it is the largest die the largest chip the world makes and then we connect two of them together with a 10 terabyte per second link okay and that makes the Blackwell computer and the performance is incredible take a look at this so um you see you see our uh the the computational the flops the AI flops uh for each generation has increased by a thousand times in eight years Mo's law in eight years is something along the lines of oh I don't know maybe 40 60 and in the last eight years Moors law has gone a lot lot less and so just to compare even Moors law at its best of times compared to what Blackwell could do so the amount of computations is incredible and when whenever we bring the computation High the thing that happens is the cost goes down and I'll show you what we've done is we've increased through its computational capability the energy used to train a gp4 2 trillion parameter 8 trillion Tokens The amount of energy that is used has gone down by 350 times Well Pascal would have taken 1,000 gwatt hours 1,000 gwatt hours means that it would take a gigawatt data center the world doesn't have a gigawatt data center but if you had a gigawatt data center it would take a month if you had 100 watt 100 megawatt data center it would take about a year and so nobody would of course um uh create such a thing and um and that's the reason why these large language models chat GPT was impossible only eight years ago by us driving down the increasing the performance the energy efficent while keeping and improving energy efficent efficiency along the way we've now taken with Blackwell what used to be 1,000 gwatt hours to three an incredible Advance uh 3 gwatt hours if it's a if it's a um uh uh a 10,000 gpus for example it would only take a coule 10,000 gpus I guess it would take a few days 10 days or so so the amount of advance in just eight years is incredible well this is for inference this is for token generation Our token generation performance has made it possible for us to drive the energy down by three 45,000 times 177,000 Jewels per token that was Pascal 177,000 Jewels it's kind of like two light bulbs running for two days it would take two light bulbs running for two days amounts of energy 200 Watts running for two days to generate one token of gp4 it takes about three tokens to generate one word and so the amount of energy used necessary for Pascal to generate gp4 and have a chat GPT experience with you was practically impossible but now we only use 0.4 Jew per token and we can generate tokens at incredible rates and very little energy okay so Blackwell is just an enormous lead well even so it's not big enough and so we have to build even larger machines and so the way that we build it is called dgx so this is this is our Blackwell chips and it goes into dgx systems that's why we should practice so this is a dgx Blackwell this has this is air cooled has eight of these gpus inside look at the size of the heat sinks on these gpus about 15 kilowatt 15,000 watts and completely air cooled this version supports x86 and it's it goes into the infrastructure that we've been shipping Hoppers into however if you you would like to have liquid cooling we have a new system and this new system is based on this board and we call it mgx for modular and this modular system you won't be able to see this this can they see this can you see this you can the are you okay I say and so this is the mgx system and here's the two uh black Blackwell boards so this one node has four Blackwell chips these four Blackwell chips this is liquid cooled nine of them nine of them uh well 72 of these 72 of these gpus 72 of these G gpus are then connected together with a new MV link this is MV link switch fifth generation and the mvlink switch is a technology Miracle this is the most advanced switch the world's ever made the data rate is insane and these switches connect every single one of these black Wells to each other so that we have one giant 72 GPU Blackwell well the benefit the benefit of this is that in one domain one GPU domain this now looks like one GPU this one GPU has 72 versus the last generation of eight so we increased it by nine times the amount of bandwidth we've increased by 18 times the AI flops we've increased by 45 times and yet the amount of power is only 10 times this is 100 kilowatt and that is 10 kilow and that's for one now of course well you could always connect more of these together and I'll show you how to do that in a second but what's the miracle is this chip this MV link chip people are starting to awaken to the importance of this mvlink chip as it connects all these different gpus together because the large language models are so large it doesn't fit on just one GPU doesn't fit on one just just one node it's going to take the entire rack of gpus like this new dgx that I that I was just standing next to uh to to hold a large language model that are tens of trillions of parameters large mvlink which in itself is a technology Miracle is 50 billion transistors 74 ports at 400 gbits each four lengths cross-sectional bandwidth of 7 7.2 terabytes per second but one of the important things is that it has mathematics inside the switch so that we can do reductions which is really important in deep learning right on the Chip And so this is what this is what um a dgx looks like now and a lot of people ask us um you know they say and there's this there's this confusion about what Nvidia does and and um how is it possible that that Nvidia became so big building gpus and so there's an impression that this is what a GPU looks like now this is a GPU this is one of the most advanced gpus in the world but this is a gamer GPU but you and I know that this is what a GPU looks like this is one GPU ladies and gentlemen dgx GPU you know the back of this GPU is the MV link spine the MV link spine is 5,000 wires two miles and it's right here this is an mvlink spine and it connects 702 gpus to each other this is a electrical mechanical Miracle the transceivers makes it possible for us to drive the entire length in Copper and as a result this switch the mvy switch mvlink switch driving the mvlink spine in Copper makes it possible for us to save 20 kilow in one rack 20 kilowatts could now be used for processing just an incredible achievement so this is the the MV links [Applause] spine wow I went down today and if you and even this is not big enough even this is not big enough for AI factories so we have to connect it all together with very high-speed networking well we have two types of networking we have infin band which has been used uh in supercomputing and AI factories all over the world and it is growing incredibly fast for us however not every data center can handle infiniband because they've already invested their ecosystem in Ethernet for too long and it does take some specialty and some expertise to manage infiniband switches and infiniband networks and so what we've done is we've brought the capabilities of infiniband to the ethernet architecture which is incredibly hard and the reason for that is this ethernet was designed for high average throughput because every single note every single computer is connected to a different person on the internet and most of the communications is the data center with somebody on the other side of the internet however deep learning in AI factories the gpus are not communicating with people on the internet mostly it's communicating with each other they're communicating with each other because they're all they're collecting partial products and they have to reduce it and then redistribute it chunks of partial products reduction redistribution that traffic is incredibly bursty and it is not the average throughput that matters it's the last arrival that matters because if you're reducing collecting partial products from everybody if I'm trying to take all of your so it's not the average throughput it's whoever gives me the answer last okay ethernet has no provision for that and so there are several things that we had to create we created an endtoend architecture so that the the Nick and the switch can communicate and we applied four different Technologies to make this possible number one Nvidia has the world's most advanced RDMA and so now we have the ability to have a network level RDMA for ethernet that is incredibly great number two we have congestion control the switch does Telemetry at all times incredibly fast and whenever the uh the uh the the gpus or the the Nyx are sending too much information we can tell them to back off so that it doesn't create hotspots number three adaptive routing ethernet needs to transmit and receive in order we see congestions or we see uh ports that are not currently being used irrespective of the ordering we will send it to the available ports and Bluefield on the other end reorders it so that it comes back in order that adaptive routing incredibly powerful and then lastly noise isolation there's more than one model being trained or something happening in the data center at all times and their noise and their traffic could get into each other and causes Jitter and so when it when the noise of one training model one model training causes the last arrival to end up too late it really slows down to training well overall remember you have you have built A5 billion dollar or3 billion doll Data Center and you're using this for training if the utilization Network utilization was 40% lower and as a result the training time was 20% longer the5 billion data center is effectively like a$6 billion doll data center so the cost is incredible the cost impact is quite High ethernet with Spectrum X basically allows us to improve the performance so much that the network is basically free and so this is really quite an achievement we're very we have a whole pipeline of ethernet products behind us this is Spectrum x800 it is uh 51.2 terabits per second and 256 radic the next one coming is 512 radic is one year from now 512 Radix and that's called Spectrum x800 Ultra and the one after that is x1600 but the important idea is this x800 is designed for tens of thousands tens T of thousands of gpus x800 ultra is designed for hundreds of thousands of gpus and x1600 is designed for millions of gpus the days of millions of GPU data centers are coming and the reason for that is very simple of course we want to train much larger models but very importantly in the future almost every interaction you have with the Internet or with a computer will likely have a generative AI running in the cloud somewhere and that generative AI is working with you interacting with you generating videos or images or text or maybe a digital human and so you're interacting with your computer almost all the time and there's always a generative AI connected to that some of it is on Prem some of it is on your device and a lot of it could be in the cloud these generative AIS will also do a lot of reasoning capability instead of just one shot answer they might iterate on answers so that it improve the quality of the answer before they give it to you and so the amount of generation we're going to do in the future is going to be extraordinary let's take a look at all of this put together now tonight this is our first nighttime keyote I want to thank I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight at 7:00 and and so what I'm about to show you has a new Vibe okay there's a new Vibe this is kind of the nighttime keynote Vibe so enjoy this black [Music] let's go go go go go okay [Music] [Music] [Music] come on yeah yeah yeah yeah get it y get it y let's go [Music] [Applause] the more you back the more you sa with top ey Tor made that's to speed a [Music] [Applause] now you can't do that on a morning keynote I think that style of keynote has never been done in compy Tex ever might be the last only Nvidia can pull off that only I could do that [Applause] Blackwell of course uh is the first generation of Nvidia platforms that was launched at the beginning at the right as the world knows the generative AI era is here just as the world realized the importance of AI factories just as the beginning of this new Industrial Revolution uh we have so much support nearly every OEM every computer maker every CSP every GPU Cloud Sovereign clouds even telecommunication companies Enterprises all over the world the amount of success the amount of adoption the amount of of uh enthusiasm for Blackwell is just really off the charts and I want to thank everybody for that we're not stopping there uh during this during the time of this incredible growth we want to make sure that we continue to enhance performance continue to drive down cost cost of training cost of inference and continue to scale out AI capabilities for every company to embrace the further we the further performance we drive up the Greater the cost decline Hopper platform of course was the most successful data center processor probably in history and this is just an incredible incredible success story however Blackwell is here and every single platform as you'll notice are several things you got the CPU you have the GPU you have MV link you have the Nick and you have the switch the the mvlink switch the uh connects all of the gpus together as large of a domain as we can and whatever we can do we connect it with large um very large and very highspeed switches every single generation as you'll see is not just a GPU but it's entire platform we build the entire platform we integrate the entire platform into an AI Factory supercomputer however then we this aggregate it and offer it to the world and the reason for that is because all of you could create interesting and Innovative configurations and and and all kinds of different uh uh Styles and and fit different uh data centers and different customers in different places some of it for Edge some of it for Telco and all of the different Innovation are POS possible if it would we made the systems open and make it possible for you to innovate and so we design it integrated but we offer it to you disintegrated so that you could create modular systems the Blackwell platform is here our company is on a one-year Rhythm we our basic philosophy is very simple one build the entire data center scale disaggregated and sell it to you in Parts on a one-year Rhythm and we push everything the technology limits whatever tsmc process technology will push it to the absolute limits whatever packaging technology push it to the absolute limits whatever memory technology push it to Absolute limits series technology Optics technology everything is pushed to the Limit well and then after that do everything in such a way so that all of our software runs on this entire install base software inertia is the single most important thing in computers it'll when a computer is backwards compatible and it's architecturally compatible with all the software that has already been created your ability to go to market is so much faster and so the velocity is incredible when we can take advantage of the entire installed base of software has already been created well Blackwell is here next year is Blackwell Ultra just as we had h100 and h200 you'll probably see some pretty exciting New Generation from us for black Blackwell Ultra again again push to the limits and the Next Generation Spectrum switches I mentioned well this is the very first time that this next click has been made and I'm not sure yet whe I'm going to regret this or [Applause] not we have code names in our company and uh we try to keep them very secret uh often times uh most of the employees don't even know but our next Generation platform is called Reuben the Reuben platform the Reuben platform um I'm I'm not going to spend much time on it uh I know what's going to happen you're going to take pictures of it and you're going to go look at the fine prints uh and feel free to do that so we have the Reuben platform and one year later we' have the Reuben um Ultra platform all of these chips that I'm showing you here are all in full development 100% of them and the rhythm is one year at the limits of Technology all 100% architecturally compatible so this is this is basically what Nvidia is building and all of the riches of software on top of it so in a lot of ways the last 12 years from that moment of imag net and US realizing that the future of computing was going to radically change to today is really exactly as I was holding up earlier GeForce pre 20102 and Nvidia today the company has really transformed tremendously and I want to thank all of our partners here for supporting us every step along the way this is the Nvidia black wall platform let me talk about what's next the next wave of AI is physical AI AI that understands the laws of physics AI that can work among us and so they have to understand the world model so that they understand how to interpret the world how to perceive the world they have to of course have excellent cognitive capabilities so they can understand us understand what we asked and perform the tasks in the future robotics is a much more p pervasive idea of course when I say robotics there's a humanoid robotics that's usually the representation of that but that's not at all true everything is going to be robotic all of the factories will be robotic the factories will orchestrate robots and those robots will be building products that are robotic robots interacting with robots building products that are robotic well in order for us to do that we need to make some breakthroughs and let me show you the video the era of Robotics has arrived one day everything that moves will be autonomous researchers and companies around the world are developing robots powered by physical AI physical AIS are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world multimodal llms are breakthroughs that enable robots to learn perceive and understand the world around them and plan how they'll act and from Human demonstrations robots can now learn the skills required to interact with the world using gross and fine motor skills one of the integral Technologies for advancing robotics is reinforcement learning just as llms need rhf or reinforcement learning from Human feedback to learn particular skills generative physical AI can learn skills using reinforcement learning from physics feedback in a simulated World these simulation environments are where robots learn to make decisions by performing actions in a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics in these robot gyms a robot can learn to perform complex and dynamic tasks safely and quickly refining their skills through millions of Acts of trial and error we built Nvidia Omniverse as the operating system where physical a can be created Omniverse is a development platform for virtual world simulation combining realtime physically based rendering physics simulation and generative AI Technologies in Omniverse robots can learn how to be robots they learn how to autonomously manipulate objects with Precision such as grasping and handling objects or navigate environments autonomously finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles and Hazards learning in Omniverse minimizes the Sim to real Gap and maximizes the transfer of learned beh Behavior building robots with generative physical AI requires three computers Nvidia AI supercomputers to train the models Nvidia Jetson Orin and Next Generation Jetson Thor robotic supercomputer to run the models an Nvidia Omniverse where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds we build the platforms acceleration libraries and AI models needed by developers and companies and allow them to use any or all of the stacks that suit them best the next wave of AI is here robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize [Music] Industries this isn't the future this is happening now there are several ways that we're going to serve the market the first we're going to create platforms for each type of robotic systems one for robotic factories and warehouses one for robots that manipulate things one for robots that move and one for uh robots that are humanoid and so each one of these robotic robotics platform is like almost everything else we do a computer acceler libraries and pre-train models computers acceleration libraries pre-train models and we test everything we train everything and integrate everything inside Omniverse where Omniverse is as the video was saying where robots learn how to be robots now of course the ecosystem of robotic warehouses is really really complex it takes a lot of companies a lot of tools a lot of technology to build a modern warehouse and warehouses are increasingly robotic one of these things days will be fully robotic and so in each one of these ecosystems we have sdks and apis that are connected into the software industry sdks and apis connected into Edge AI industry um and companies and then also of course uh systems that are designed for plc's and robotic systems for the odms it's then integrated by integrators uh created for ultimately uh building warehouses uh for customers here we have an example of kenmac building a robotic warehouse for giant giant group okay and then here now let's talk about factories factories has a completely different ecosystem and foxcon is building some of the world's most advanced factories their ecosystem again Edge Computers and Robotics software for designing the factories the workflows programming the robots and of course PLC computers that orchestrate uh the digital factories and the AI factories we have sdks uh that are connected into each one of these ecosystems as well this is happening all over Taiwan foxcon has buil is building digital twins of their factories Delta is building digital twins of their factories by the way half is real half half is digital half is Omniverse pegatron is building digital twins of their robotic factories wistron is building digital twins of their robotic factories and this is really cool this is a video of foxc con's new Factory let's take a look demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing is skyrocketing as the World modernizes traditional data centers into generative AI factories foxcon the world's largest electronics manufacturer is gearing up to meet this Demand by building robotic factories with Nvidia Omniverse and AI Factory planners use Omniverse to integrate facility and Equipment data from leading industry applications like seamen team Center X and Autodesk Revit in the digital twin they optimize floor layout and line configurations and locate optimal camera placements to monitor future operations with Nvidia Metropolis powered Vision AI virtual integration saves planners on the enormous cost of physical change orders during construction the foxcon teams use the digital twin as the source of Truth to communicate and validate accurate equipment layout the Omniverse digital twin is also the robot gym where foxcon developers train and test Nvidia ISAC AI applications for robotic perception and manipulation and Metropolis AI applications for Sensor Fusion in Omniverse foxcon simulates two robot AIS before deploying run times to Jets and computers on the assembly line they simulate Isaac manipulator libraries and AI models for automated Optical inspection for object identification defect detection and trajectory planning to transfer hgx systems to the test pods they simulate Isaac perceptor powered fobot amrs as they perceive and move about their environment with 3D mapping and reconstruction with Omniverse foxcon builds their robotic factories that orchestrate robots running on Nvidia ISAC to build Nvidia AI supercomputers which which in turn train boxon [Music] [Applause] robots so a robotic Factory is designed with three computers train the AI on Nvidia AI you have the robot running on the PLC systems uh for orchestrating the the the uh the factories and then you of course simulate everything inside Omniverse well the robotic arm and the robotic amrs are also the same way three computer systems the difference is the two omniverses will come together so they'll share one virtual space when they share one virtual space that robotic arm will become inside the robotic Factory and again three three uh three computers and we provide the computer the acceleration layers and pre-train uh pre-train AI models we've connected Nvidia manipulator and Nvidia Omniverse with Seamans the world's leading Industrial Automation software and systems company this is really a fantastic partnership and they're working on factories all over the world semantic pick aai now integrates Isaac manipulator and sematic pick AI uh runs operates ABB CA yasawa uh Fook uh Universal robotics um and techman and so semmens is a fantastic integration we have all kinds of other Integrations let's take a look arcbest is integrating Isaac perceptor into Vox smart autonomy robots for enhanced object recognition and human motion tracking in Material Handling byd Electronics is integrating Isaac manipulator and percep ctor into their AI robots to enhance manufacturing efficiencies for Global customers ideal works is building Isaac perceptor into their iwos software for AI robots in Factory Logistics intrinsic an alphabet company is adopting Isaac manipulator into their Flow State platform to advance robot grasping Gideon is integrating Isaac perceptor into Trey AI powered forklifts to advance AI enabled Logistics Argo robotics is adopting Isaac perceptor into perception engine for Advanced Vision based amrs Solomon is using Isaac manipulator AI models in their acup piic 3D software for industrial manipulation techman robot is adopting Isaac Sim and manipulator into TM flow accelerating automated Optical inspection pteridine robotics is integrating Isaac manipulator into po scope X for cobots and Isaac perceptor into mere amrs vention is integrating Isaac manipulator into machine Logic for AI manipulation [Music] robots robotics is here physical AI is here this is not science fiction and it's being used all over Taiwan and just really really exciting and that's the factory the robots inside and of course all the products are going to be robotics there are two very high volume robotics products one of course is the self-driving car or cars that have a great deal of autonomous capability Nvidia again builds the entire stack next year we're going to go to production with the Mercedes Fleet and after that in 2026 the jlr fleet uh we offer the full stack to the world however you're welcome to take whichever Parts uh which whichever layer of our stack just as the entire the entire uh uh Drive stack is open the next high volume robotics product that's going to be manufactured by robotic factories with robots inside will likely be humanoid robots and this has great progress in recent years in both the cognitive capability because of foundation models and also the world understanding capability that we're in the process of developing I'm really excited about this area because obviously the easiest robot to adapt into the world are human or robots because we built the world for us we also have the vast the most amount of data to train these robots than other types of robots because we have the same uh physique and so the amount of training data we can provide through demonstration capabilities and video capabilities is going to be really great and so we're going to see a lot of progress in this area well I think we have um some robots that we' like to uh welcome there we go about my [Applause] size and we have we have some friends to join us so the fut the future of robot robotics is here the next wave of AI and and of course you know Taiwan builds computers with keyboards you build computers for your pocket you build computers for data centers in the cloud in the future you're going to build computers that walk and computers that roll you know around and um so these are all just computers and as as it turns out uh the technology is very similar to the technology of building um all of the other computers that you already build today so this is going to be a really extraordinary uh Journey for us well uh I want to thank I want to I want to thank I want to I have I've I've made one last video if you don't mind uh something that that uh uh uh we we really enjoyed making um and if you let's run it [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you I love you guys thank [Applause] you thank you all for coming have a great comput text thank [Applause] you I will make you like me yeah singing with me [Music] once again a come T we will show you all about best yeah digital dreams and me with to all of in Tai we hope that you like this song yeah good me and [Music] [Music] once get thank you for joining us yeah digal Twins and me we been I [Music] feeled hey I am awake for the new day feeling the sun upon my face I'm all the bad vibes away look to the sky I have this moment inside the glove I am the Sun up so high above I am the star you are thinking know take a minute now take a minute to see take a minute now we are put in the SE this is everything that I could ever KN on the top again in the land of the free and e e e hello everyone welcome sigraph it is my first sigraph I'm so excited to be here I'm so excited to speak to all of you and I'm so excited to speak to Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen hang great to see you again thank you great to see you welcome to sigraph Lauren Welcome To My Hood you're regular here huh hey everybody great to see you guys Jensen it is like 99 degrees outside I know it's freezing in here isn't it I mean I don't know I'm shaking leather jacket yeah feels great looks good too all right so you have I'm wearing a brand new one oh a brand new one yeah how many of those do you have I don't know but Lori got me a new one for sigraph she said you're excited about cigar here's a new jacket go go do good job I look sharp thank you all right uh you have a long history of sigraph I mean when you think about the history of this conference which has been going on since 1974 and you think about the history of Nvidia from the 1990s onward where your DNA was really in you know know computer Graphics uh helping to make beautiful Graphics what is the significance of Nvidia being here today right now at a conference like sigraph well you know uh sigraph used to be about computer Graphics now it's about computer graphics and generative AI it's about simulation it's about generative Ai and and we all know that the Journey of Nvidia which started out in computer Graphics as you said um uh really brought us here and so I made a cartoon for you I made a cartoon for you of our journey did you make it or did J of AI make it I I I had it hang on a second I had it made I had it made um that's what CEOs do we don't do anything we just have it be done it kind of starts something like this hey guys would it be great if we had a cartoon and it Illustrated some of the most important milestones in the computer industry and how it led to Nvidia and where we are today and and so we Illustrated and also do it in three hours and do three hours right and and so this is this cartoon here is really terrific so these are some of the some of the most important moments in the computer industry uh the IBM system 360 of course the invention of modern Computing uh the teapot 1975 the Utah teapot 1979 Ray tracing um uh Turner wited uh one of the great researchers Nvidia researcher for a long time uh 1986 programmable shading uh of course uh most of the animated movies that we see today wouldn't be possible if not for programmable shading originally done on the CRA supercomputer uh led to uh what and then in 1993 Nvidia was founded Chris Curtis and I founded the company 19 1995 Windows PC revolutionized uh the personal computer industry uh put a personal computer in every home and every desk uh multimedia PC was uh was invented 2001 we invented uh the first programmable shading GPU and and that that really uh drove uh vast majority of nvidia's Journey up to that point But at the background of everything we were doing was accelerated computing and accelerate and and we believe that you could create a type of computing model that could augment the general purpose Computing so that you can solve problems that normal computers can't and the application we chose first was computer graphics and it was probably one of the best decisions we ever made because computer Graphics was insanely computationally in intensive and remained so uh for the entire 31 years that that Nvidia has been here and since the beginning of computer Graphics in fact required a crazy supercomputer to render some of the original scenes so it kind of tells you how computationally intensive it was and it was also incredibly high volume because we applied computer Graphics to an application at the time that uh wasn't mainstream 3D Graphics video games the combination of very large volume very complicated Computing problem led to a very large R&D budget for us which drove the flywheel of our company that observation we made in 1993 was spoton and it led us to be able to Pioneer the work that we're doing in accelerated Computing we tried it many times Cuda was of course the Revolutionary version but prior to that we had a Computing model we call CG C for graphics C on top of gpus and so we've been working on accelerated Computing for a long time uh promoting and evangelizing Cuda getting Cuda everywhere and putting on every single one of our gpus so that this computing model was compatible with the with any application that was written for it irrespective of which generation of our processors that was a great decision and one one day in 2012 we made our first Contact you know Star Trek first Contact with artificial intelligence that first Contact was alexnet it was in 2012 very big moment uh we made the observation that alexnet was an incredible breakthrough in computer vision but at the core of it deep learning was deeply profound that it was a new way of writing software instead of Engineers given input imagining what the output was going to be write algorithms we now have a computer that given an input and example outputs would figure out what the program is in the middle that observation and that we can use this technique to solve a whole bunch of problems that previously wasn't solvable was a great observation and we changed everything in our company to pursue it from the processor to the systems to the software stack all the algorithms Nvidia basic research pivoted towards working on deep learning uh by the way this is a great place for research as you know nvidia's uh passionate about about uh uh sigraph and this year we have 20 papers that are at the intersection of generative Ai and simulation and so in 20 2016 uh we introduced the first computer we built for deep learning and we called it djx1 and I delivered the first djx1 outside of our company I built it for NVIDIA to build models for self-driving cars and Robotics and such and and generative AI for graphics uh but we uh somebody saw an example of djx1 Elon reached out to me and said hey I would love to have one of those for a startup company we're starting and so I delivered the first one to a company at the time uh that knew nobody knew about called open a I and so that was 2016 uh 2017 was the Transformer uh that revolutionized modern uh machine learning modern deep learning in 2018 right here at sigraph we announced RTX the world's first realtime interactive R Tracer R tracing platform we call it RTX it was such a big deal that we changed the name of GTX which everybody refer to our graphics cards as to RTX uh another shout out for for uh uh a great researcher his name is Steph Parker uh many of you know he's been coming to C for a long time uh he passed this year and uh he was a a he was one of the one of the core uh Pioneer researchers behind realtime R raate tracing and we miss them dearly and so anyways uh and you mentioned last year during your sigraph keynote that RTX R tracing extreme was one of the big important moments when computer Graphics met AI That's right but that had been happening for a while actually so what was so what was so important about RTX in 2018 well RTX in 2018 so you know we uh we accelerated uh Ray traversal and bounding box uh detection and and um uh and we made it possible to uh use a parallel processor to accelerate rate tracing um but even then we were rate tracing at about you know frame every call it you know 10 frames maybe every second let's say maybe five frames every second depending on on how how many how many Rays we're talking about tracing and we were doing it at 1080 resolution uh obviously video games uh need a lot more than that obviously real-time Graphics need more than that this crowd definitely knows what that means but for the folks who are watching online who don't work in this field I mean this is basically a way of really manipulating light in computer Graphics simulating how a light interacts with versus through right happening in real time that's right the rendering processes used to take a really long time when you were making something it used to take a Cay supercomputer to render just a few pixels and now we have our RTX to accelerate that rate tracing but it was interactive it was real time but it wasn't fast enough to be uh a video game and so we realized that that we needed a big boost probably something along the lines of 20x or so maybe 50x or so boost and so uh the team uh invented dlss which basically renders one pixel while it uses AI to infer a whole bunch of other pixels and so we basically taught an AI that is conditioned on what it saw and then say fills in fills in the dots for everything else and now we're able to render fully Ray Trace fully path Trace simulation ations at 4K resolution at 300 frames per second made possible by by Ai and so 2018 came along uh 2022 as we all know chat GPT came out but the and what's that again chat GPT you know that yes open AI chat GPT a revolutionary revolutionary new uh new capability Ai and fastest growing service in history um but the two things that I wanted to highlight since since jgp the industry researchers um many of them in the room has figured out how to use AI to learn everything not just words but to learn the meaning of images and videos and 3D chemicals protein physics thermal dynamics fluid dynamics particle physics it's figured out the meaning of these uh all these different modalities and since then not only have we learned it we can now generate it and so you could that's the reason why you can go from text to images text to 3D images to text 3D to text text to video so on so forth text to proteins text to chemicals and so now generative AI has been uh made possible and this is really the Revolutionary time that we're in just about every industry is going to be affected by this just based on based on some of the examples I've already given you whether it's scientific Computing trying to do a better job uh predicting the weather with a lot less energy to uh augmenting and collaborating with with us uh creators to generate images or you know generating virtual scenes for industrial digitalization and very importantly robotics self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative Ai and so here we are in this brand new way of doing things and so let me just very quickly Lauren if you look at where we started in the upper left in 1964 uh the way that software was programmed human Engineers programming software now we have machines that are learning how to program the software de writing software that no humans can solving problems that we we could barely imagine before and now because we have generative AI a new way of developing software you know you you you I don't know if you know do you know Andre karpathy he's a really really terrific researcher I met him when he was at Stanford and and uh he coined the original way of doing software software 1.0 machine learning to be software 2.0 and now really we're moving toward software 3.0 because these generative AIS in the future instead of using machine learning to learn a new AI for every researcher you'll probably start with pre-trained models Foundation models that are already pre-trained and the way that we develop software could very very much be like assembling teams with Experts of various AI capabilities some that are using uh tools some that are able to generate you know special things and then a general purpose AI that's really good at reasoning that's connecting this this network of AIS together solving problems like team solve problems and so software 3.0 is here I've gotten the sense from talking to you recently that you are optimistic that this these generative AI tools will become more controllable more accurate we all know that there are issues with hallucinations uh low quality outputs that people are using these tools and they're maybe not getting exactly the output that they're hoping for right meanwhile they're using a lot of energy which we're going to talk about why are you so optimistic about this what is what do you think is pointing Us in the direction of this generative AI actually becoming that much more useful and controllable well uh the big breakthrough of Chad GPT uh was reinforcement learning human feedback which was uh the way of using humans to produce the right answers or the best answers to align the AI on our core values or align our AI on the skills that we would like it to perform that's probably the just the extraordinary breakthrough that made it possible for them to open chat GPT for everyone everyone to use other breakthroughs have have uh arrived since then Guard railing which uh which causes the AI to focus its energy or Focus its response in a particular domain so that uh it doesn't wander off and pontificate about all kinds of stuff that you ask it about it would only focus on the things that it's been trained to do align to perform and um uh that it it has deep knowledge in the third the third breakthrough is called uh retrieval augmented generation which basically is vectorized or data that has been uh embedded so that we understand the meaning of that data and so it's a more authoritative data set it goes beyond just the trained data set and it actually pulls from other sources that's right it's not just pre-ra data source it's and something you know for example uh it might be uh all of the articles that you've ever written all of the papers that you've ever written and so now it becomes uh something an AI That's authoritative on your uh and it could be essentially a uh a chatbot of you uh so everything that I've ever written or ever said could be vectorized and then created into a semantic database and then before an AI responds it would uh figure it would look at look at your prompt and it would uh it would uh search uh the appropriate content from that Vector database and then augment it um in its gener generative process and you think that that is one of the most important factors these three combinations really made it possible for us to do that with text now the thing that's really cool is that we are now starting to figure out how to do that with visuals right and you know sigraph is really about a lot about images and and generation and so if you look at today's generative AI uh you could give it a a prompt and it goes into uh in this particular case this is a uh edify uh AI model that Nvidia created it's a 2d text to 2D Foundation model it's multimodal and um uh we used uh we partnered with GTI to use uh their library of data uh to train uh an AI model and so this is a a text to uh 2D image and you also created this slide personally right I well I had I personally had the slide created and so imagine I'm the prompt and then there's a team that that's kind of like a generative Ai and then magically uh this slide shows up and so so here here's a prompt uh and this could be a prompt for somebody who owns a brand it could be a brand of um for in this case Coca-Cola it could be a car it could be a luxury product it could be anything and so uh you you use the prompt and generate the image however as you know it's hard to control this prompt and it may hallucinate uh it may um uh create it in such a way that it's not exactly what you want and to fine-tune this using words is really really hard because as you know words is very low dimensional ity it's extremely compressed in its content but it's it's very imprecise and so the ability for us to now control that image uh is difficult to do and so we've created a way that allows us to uh control and align that with more conditioning and so the way you do that is we create another model and this model for example allows us to text to 3D on the bottom it's called and it's edify 3D one of our foundation models we've created this AI Foundry where Partners can come and work with us and we create the model for them with their data we invent the model and they bring their data and we uh create a model that they can take with them is it their data only uses their data so this only uses all of the data that's available on Shutterstock uh that they have have the rights to to use the train and so we now use prompt generator 3D we put that in Omniverse Omniverse uh as you know is a is a place where you could compose uh data and content from a lot of different modalities it could be 3D it could be AI it could be animation it could be materials and so we use Omniverse to compose all of these multimodality uh data and now you can control it you could you could change the pose you could change the placement you could change whatever you like and then you use that image out of Omniverse to condition The Prompt okay so you take what comes out of Omniverse you now augment it with the prompt it's a little bit like augment retrieval augment a mented generation this is now 3D augmented generation Getty uh the edified model is multimodal so it understand the image understands the prompt and it uses it in combination to create a new image so now this is a controlled image and so this way we can use uh generative AI as a as a collaborator as a you know as a partner to to work with us um and uh uh we can generate images exactly the way we like it how does this translate to the physical world how does it translate to something like robotics well we're going to talk about robotics but one of the things that I would love to show you and I had this made not by myself well I had it made myself okay this is an Incredible video and this is a uh this is a work that is done by wpp uh Shutterstock uh working with uh some of the brand uh world class world famous brands that you'll you'll know let's run the video Let's show the build me a table in an empty room surrounded by chairs in a busy restaurant build me a table with tacos and bowls of salsa in the Morning Light build me a car on an empty road surrounded by trees buy a modern house build me a house with hills in the distance and bales of hay in the Evening Sun build me a tree in an empty field build me hundred of them in all Direction with bushes and Vines hanging in between building a giant brain forest with exotic flowers and rays of sunlight isn't that incredible and so so let so this is so this is this is what happened we taught we taught an AI how to speak USD open USD and so the young the the the girl is speaking to Omniverse Omniverse generates the USD and use USD search to then find the catalog of uh 3D objects that it has it composes the scene using words and and then um generative AI uh uses that augmentation to generate uh to condition the generation process and and so therefore uh the work that you do could be much much better controlled you could even collaborate with people because you can collaborate in Omniverse and you can collaborate in 3D it's hard to collaborate uh in 2D and so we can collaborate in 3D augment the generation process I imagine a lot of people in this room who aren't just technical but they're also storytellers this is a very technical room storytellers see something like this there's like 90% phds in here and think I'm not even going to ask you to do a raising of your hand but I'm sure that would be fascinating so they see something like this I see something like this and I think okay that's pretty amazing you are speeding up rendering times you're creating images out of nothing there are probably just as many people thinking what does this mean for my job where do you draw the line between this is augmenting and helping people where do you see the line being drawn and this is replacing certain things that humans do well that's what tools do uh we invent tools here this you know this conference is about inventing technology that ultimately ends up being a tool and that Tool uh either accelerates our work um uh collaborates with us so that we could do uh better work or even bigger work uh do work that's uh impossible before and so I think what you're going to what you you'll likely see is that generative AI uh is now going to be more controllable than before we've been able to do that with using uh Rags retrieval augmented generation to control uh text generation better reducing hallucination now we're using Omniverse with generative AI to control generative uh images better and reduce hallucination both of those tools uh help us be more productive and do things that we otherwise can't do and so I think I think um for all of the artists in the world I what I would say is is uh jump on this tool give it a try um imagine the stories that you're going to be able to tell uh with these tools and um uh and with respect to jobs uh I would say that it is very likely all of our jobs are going to be changed in what way well my job is going to change um the way in the future uh I'm going to be prompting a whole bunch of AIS uh everybody will have an AI that is an assistant and so every single company every single company every single job within the company will have AIS that are assistant to them our software programmers as you so you know now have AIS that help them program uh all all of our software Engineers have AIS that help them debug software uh we have AIS that help our chip designers design chips uh without without AI uh Hopper wouldn't have been possible without AI Blackwell wouldn't be possible you know today we're this week we're sampling we're sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world they're under people's chairs right now I think if you just look if you get a GPU and you and I yeah you get a GPU you get a GPU yeah that's right supply chain we all we all we all wish yeah yeah and so so um I none none of the work that we do would be possible anymore without without generative Ai and uh that's increasingly the case with uh uh uh Our IT department helping our employees be more productive uh it's increasingly the case with our supply chain team optimizing Supply uh to be as efficient as possible um or our data center team using AI to manage the data center to save as much energy as possible you mentioned Omniverse before yeah uh that's not new but the idea that more generative AI would be within the Omniverse helping people create these simulations or digital twins yeah that's what we're announcing this week by the way Omniverse now Omniverse now uh understands uh text to USD um it could understand text to uh and has a semantic database so that it could do search of all the 3D objects um and uh that's how that that young lady was able to to say fill fill uh the scene with a whole bunch of trees uh describing how she would like the trees to be organized and somehow populates it with all these 3D trees then when that when that's done that 3D scene then goes into a generative AI uh uh model which turns turns it into a photorealistic model and if you want the the Ford truck to not be augmented but to use the the the actual brand um brand ground Truth uh then it would it would honor that and keep that uh keep that in the or in the final scene and so so I think if you if you if you do that uh so one of the things that that we talked about is how every single every single group in the company uh will have will have ai assistance and and um there's a lot of question lately about about um uh whether all this infrastructure that we're building is leading to productive work in companies I just gave you an example of how generative AI is impossible without without uh Nvidia nvidia's designs would be impossible without generative AI so we use it to transform the way we work but we also use it uh in many examples that I've just shown you in creating new products and new technology that either makes possible uh rate tracing in real time uh or Omniverse that we can now uh uh imagine and help us uh create much larger scenes um or uh our self-driving car work or our robotics work uh none of that none of that new capability would be possible without it and so one of the things that that we're announcing here uh this week is uh the concept of uh digital uh agents uh digital AIS uh that will augment every single job in the company and so uh one of the one of the the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service and every single group every single company has customer service every single industry has customer service uh and in the future uh it's going today it's it's humans uh doing customer service but in the future my guess is that it's going to be human still but AI in the loop and the benefit of that is that you'll be able to uh uh retain uh the the um uh the experiences of all the customer service agents that you have and capture that institutional knowledge that you can then run into analytics that you can then uh use to create uh better services for your customers uh the the just now I showed you a a Omniverse augmented generation for images this is a rag this is a uh retrieval augmented generative Ai and the thing that we're doing is is uh We've created this customer service basically uh microservice that sits in the cloud and it's going to be available I think today or tomorrow and you can come and try it and we connected to it a digital human front end basically an IO uh the io of an AI that has the ability to uh speak make eye contact with you um an animate in an empathetic way um and uh uh you could decide to connect your chat chat gbt or your AI I to the digital human or you can connect um uh your digital human to our uh retrieval augmented generation uh customer service AI uh so however you like to do it we're a platform company so irrespective of which piece you would like to use uh they're completely open source and you can come and use the pieces that you like uh if you would like the incredible digital human rendering technology that we've created for uh rendering beautiful faces uh which requires subsurface scattering with path tracing this breakthrough uh is really quite incredible and it makes it possible for us amazing Graphics researchers welcome to sigraph 2024 so it makes it possible to animate uh using an AI so uh you you chat with the AI it generates text that text then is translated uh to sound text to speech that speech the sound then animates the face and and then RTX path tracing um does the does the rendering of the digital human and so all of this is available for developers to use and you could you could decide which parts you would like to use how are you thinking about the ethics of something like this you're unleashing this to developers to Graphics artists but these are being Unleashed into the world y do you think a chatbot like that a a very human like visual chatbot should say that it's a chatbot what is it so human that people start mistaking it for humans they're emotionally vulnerable it's it's still it's still pretty it's still pretty robotic and I think that that's not a terrible thing you know we're going to stay we're going to be robotic for for some time I think it we've made we've made uh this digital human technology uh quite realistic but you and I know it's still a it's still a robot and so I I think um uh that's not a that's not a a horrible way um it is the case that there are many many different applications where the human engagement is much uh much more engaging uh having a human representation or near human representation than a text box uh maybe somebody needs companion or Healthcare needs to advise um somebody who is an outpatient uh who had just gone home uh you know helping elderlies um you know there's a whole bunch of applications uh a tutor which to educate a child um all these different applications are better off having somebody who is much more human and being able to connect with uh with the audience that's interesting yeah what I hear you talking a lot about today these are software developments right they're relying on your gpus But ultimately this is software this is NVIDIA going further up the stack meanwhile there are some companies some folks in the generative AI space who are in software and Cloud services but they're looking to go further down the stack right they might be developing their own chips or tpus that are competitive with what you are doing how crucial is this software strategy to Nvidia maintaining its lead and actually fulfilling some of these promises of growth that people are looking at for NVIDIA right now well um we've always been a software company um and even first and the reason for that is because accelerated Computing is not general purpose Computing general purpose Computing can take any c program or C Supply program Python and just run it and almost everybody's uh program can be compiled to run effectively unfortunately when you want to accelerate fluid dynamics you have to understand the the algorithms of fluid dynamics so that you could uh refactor it in such way that it could be accelerated and you have to design an accelerator you have to design the cou at GPU so that it understands the algorithms so that it could do a good job accelerating it and the benefit of course is that we can by doing so by redesigning the whole stack we can accelerate applications 20 40 50 times 100 times for example uh we just put um Nvidia gpus in in uh gcp uh running pandas uh which is the world's leading uh data science platform and we accelerated from 50 to 100x over general purpose Computing uh in the case of deep learning over the course of last 10 to 12 years or so uh We've accelerated deep learning by a million times which is the reason why it's now possible for us to create these large language models a million times speed up a million times reduction in cost and energy is what made it possible for us to make General generative AI possible but that's not that's that's by designing a new processor a new system tensor core gpus the mvlink switch fabric uh is completely groundbreaking for AI of course the systems itself the algorithms the distributed computing uh uh uh Library we call Megatron that everybody uses um tensor rtlm those are algorithms and if you don't understand the algorithms the the applications above it it's really hard to figure out how to design that whole stack what is the most important part of Nvidia software ecosystem for nvidia's future well every single one of it takes a new library we call it dsl's domain specific Library um in in uh in generative AI that DSL is called qnn uh for SQL processing uh data frames is called qdf and so if you go SQL pandas uh CDF is what makes it possible for us to accelerate that for Quantum emulation it's called K Quantum uh uh C fft we got a whole bunch of coups uh computational lithography which makes it makes it possible for us to uh help the industry Advance the next generation of processed technology called K litho um you know the the number of coups it goes on and on every time we introduce a domain specific Library it exposes accelerated Computing to a new market and so as you see it takes that collaboration the the the the the um uh the full stack of the library and the architecture and the go to market and developers and the ecosystems around it to open up a new field and so it's not just about building the accelerator you have to build a whole stack nvidia's dependent on a lot of things going right your your foray into the future your Innovation depends on a lot of things going right you have to continue pushing the laws of physics you do have competitors who are nipping at your heels at all times we've talked about this what keeps you up at night uh you're also somewhat relling on the geopolitical stability last night just so you know elevation drink some water that's what they told me but it was it was too late by the time I learned about it this morning I I woke up with a a terrible headache elevation that's what was last night okay so elevation uh but truly you have to keep pushing the laws of physics you have competitors who are nipping at your heels both on the software and Hardware side you are somewhere Aliant on the geopolitical stability of the South China Sea uh geopolitics uh so much going on right now you're reminding me it's it's it's super hard building a company it is you but you've had a lot of you're making me nervous I was fine before there's so many things that he wants to go back to showing you slides uh but truly you've and you've had you've had a lot of Tailwinds and I'm just you know how optimistic are you that these the things are going to keep trending in your direction things have never trended in our Direction uh you have to will the future into existence accelerated Computing you know the world wants general purpose computing and the reason for that is because it's easy you just you just have the software it just runs twice as fast every single year don't even think about it and you know every five years is 10 times faster every 10 years is 100 times faster what's not to love but of course you can shrink a transistor but you can't shrink an atom and eventually uh the CPU architecture uh ran its course and so we it's not sensible anymore uh as the technology doesn't give us those leaps that a general purpose instrument could be good at everything you know could be good at these incredible things from Deep learning to Quantum simulation to molecular Dynamics the fluid dynamics right so on the computer graphics and so we created this accelerated Computing architecture to do that um but that that that fights that fight that's headwind do you see what I'm saying because general purpose Computing is the easy way to do it we've been doing it for 60 years why not keep doing it and so so accelerated Computing was only possible because we we deliver such extreme extraordinary speedups at a time when energy is becoming more scarce um at a time when when um uh we no longer could just ride the CPU curve any longer dard scaling is has has really uh ended and um I and so we need another approach and and that's why that's why we're here but notice every single time we want to open up a new market like qdf in order to do data processing data processing is probably what a third of the world data a third of the world's Computing every company does data processing and most companies data is in data frames you know in tabular format and so in order to create an acceleration library for tabular formats was insanely hard because what's inside those tables could be floating Point numbers 64-bit integers it could be you know numbers and letters and all kinds of stuff and so we have to figure out a way to go compute all that and so so you see that almost every single time we want to grow into something you have to go and learn it that's the reason why we're working on robotics that's the reason why we're working on autonomous vehicles to understand the algorithms that's necessary to open up that market and to understand the Computing layer underneath it so that we can deliver extraordinary results and so as you could see each each time we open up a new market um healthare digital biology the work with the amazing work we're doing there with biion Nemo and uh uh parab bricks for Gene sequencing every single time we open up a new market it just requires us to reinvent everything of that Computing and so there's nothing easy about it generative AI takes up a lot of energy I'm just saying my job's super hard but your assistance you're your AI assistants are going to make it easier right what's that somebody's got to Pat my back hey little Applause you guys Cher on yeah go ahead uh let's talk about energy yeah generative AI incredibly energy intensive y uh I am going to read from my note cards here uh According to some research chat gbt a single query takes up nearly 10 times the electricity to process a single Google search uh data centers consume 1 to 2% of overall worldwide energy but some say that it could be as much as 3 to 4% some say as much as 6% by the end of the decade uh data center workloads tripled between 25 uh 2015 and 2019 that was only 2019 um AI generative AI is taking up a large portion of all of that is there going to be enough energy to fulfill the demand of what you want to build and do yeah um yes and um a couple of observations so first there there are two or three um or or three or four uh model makers that are pushing to Frontier a couple of years ago uh they're they're probably three times that many this year but it's still it's still single digit you know it's very high single digit but call a 10 that are pushing the frontiers of um of models and the size of the models are uh call it uh twice as large every year maybe maybe uh faster than that and in order to train a model that's twice as large you need you know more than twice as much data and so the computational load is growing um probably uh by you know call it a factor of four each year just for simple simple simple thinking now that's one of the reasons why Blackwell uh is is uh so highly anticipated because we accelerated the application uh so much using the same amount of energy and so this is an example of accelerating applications uh uh at constant energy constant cost you're making it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper now the important thing though is I've only highlighted 10 companies the world has tons of companies and their data centers everywhere and Nvidia is selling gpus to a whole lot of companies and a whole lot of different data centers and so question is what's happening at the core the first thing that's actually happening is the end of CPU scaling and the beginning of accelerated Computing data processing um uh just text completion speech recognition all of those kind of basic AI things that are that are used um recommender systems uh that are used in in data centers all over the world they are moving everyone is moving from CPUs to accelerated Computing because uh they want to save energy accelerated Computing helps you save so much energy 20 times 50 times in doing the same processing so the first thing that we have to do you know as a society is accelerate every application we can can if you're doing spark data processing ex run it with accelerated spark so that you could reduce the amount of energy necessary by 20 times if you're doing SQL processing do SQL um accelerated SQL so that you could reduce the power by 20 times and so uh uh if you're doing weather simulation accelerate it when you're doing uh whatever scientific simulation you're doing accelerated uh image processing accelerated a lot of those applications used to be uh running on CPUs and general purpose Computing all of that should be accelerated going forward that's the first thing that's happening now it is that reducing the amount of energy being used all over the world absolutely the density of our gpus and density of accelerated Computing is higher energy density is higher but the amount of energy used is dramatically lower so that's the first thing that's happening of course then generative AI generative AI is probably consuming let's pick a very large number probably you know 1% or so of the world's energy but remember even if the data centers uh consume 4% of the world the goal of generative AI is not training the goal of generative AI is inference and the inference ideally we create new models for predicting weather uh predicting new materials allow us to uh um uh optimize uh our supply chain reduce the amount of energy consumed and wasted gasoline uh as we deliver products and so the goal is actually to reduce the energy consumed of the 96% and so uh very importantly you have to think about gener about AI from a longitudinal perspective not just going to school but what happens after going to school you and I both went to Stanford Stanford's not inexpensive um I think you studied something slightly different though yeah yeah sure it's a big school it's worked out well for it's worked out well for both of us and so and so so the goal of course is is is going to school is important uh but of course the important thing is is really after school and all of the contributions that we're made we're able to make the society and so generative AI is going to increase productivity it's going to Ena enable us to discover new science make things more energy efficient um don't let me don't let me finish without without showing you uh the next and so so that the lights just came on because why we were talking about energy and all of a sudden it's like the Earth was like okay Tamp down the energy usage folks I thought I thought they were G am I getting Chang we still have a few minutes so I mean I hope so I mean I'm not I'm not going to get off the stage until Mark comes on here and kicks me off how about that he's not going to do that he's a great guy so anyways uh think think think about generative AI um longitudinally and all the impact of of generative AI the second thing the next thing I'll say about generative AI is remember in the the traditional way doing Computing is called retrieval based Computing everything is pre-recorded all the stories are written pre-recorded all the images are pre-recorded all the videos are pre-recorded and so and so everything is stored off in a data center somewhere pre-recorded generative AI reduces the amount of energy necessary to go run to a data center over the network re retrieve something and bring it over the network don't forget the data center is not the only place that consumes energy the world's Data Center only rep that is only 40% of the total Computing done 60% of the energy is consumed on the internet moving the electrons around moving the bits and bites around and so generative AI is going to reduce the amount of energy on the internet because instead of having to go retrieve the information we can generate it right there on the spot because we understand the context we probably have some uh content already on the device and we can generate the response so that you don't have to go retrieve it uh somewhere else well part of that is also moving atoms around right one last thing I got to tell you laen one last thing I remember AI doesn't care where it goes to school today's data centers are are built near the power grid where Society is of course because that's where we need it in the future you're going to see data centers being built in different parts of the world where there's excess energy it's just that it costs a lot of money to bring that energy to society maybe it's in a desert maybe it's uh in places that has a lot of sustainable energy but it's not a lot of water well uh there's plenty of water as well it just happens to be undrinkable water and so uh we can use we can use water that are uh we we can we can put data centers where there's less population and um more energy okay just don't don't forget that there's there's plenty there's a lot of energy coming from the Sun there's a lot of energy in the world and what we need to do is move data centers out closer to where there's excess energy and not put everything near population well part AI doesn't care where it's trained part I'd never heard that phrase before AI doesn't care where it goes to school and that's interesting yeah it's true I'm going to think on that yeah uh part of part of calculating the carbon emissions though is also considering the supply chain it's also considering it's going all down the line uh and it requires transparency don't don't move don't move the energy to the data center use the energy where the data center is and then when you're done uh you have a highly compressed model that is essentially the compression of all the energy that was used and we can take that model and bring it back hey can we talk about the next wave so the first wave of course the first wave is accelerated Computing I think I know that she's the interviewer and we're on we're we're we're doing this on her terms but I'm the CEO so so and and and so so no Lauren we we need to come and tell tell this this group about the work that we're doing that that that uh is is really really Court to I I have so many good questions for you I know I know I want to ask you about open source which I think you're going to be talking to Mark about I I want to ask you about I have it import by the way open source is really important it's incredible yeah if not if if not for open source if not for open source uh how would all of these industries and all these companies be able to engage Ai and so look at look at all the companies and all the different Industries they're all using llama llama 2 today today llama 3.1 just came out uh people are so excited about it uh We've we've made it possible to democratize Ai and engage every single industry in AI but the thing that I want to say is this the first wave is accelerated Computing reduces energy consumed allows us to deliver continued computational demand without all of the Power continued to grow with it so number one accelerate everything it made it possible for us to have generative AI the generative AI the first wave of it of of course is all the pioneers and we you know we know many of the Pioneers open AI anthropic uh Google uh Microsoft a whole bunch of amazing companies doing this uh uh X is doing this x. is doing this amazing companies doing this the next the next wave of AI we we didn't talk about which is uh Enterprise of course one of its applications is customer service and we hope that we can uh give every single organization the ability to create their own AIS and so everybody would be augmented and and have a collaborative AI that could um uh Empower them help them do better work the next wave of AI after that is called physical Ai and this is this is really really quite extraordinary this is where we're going to need three computers one computer to uh create the AI another computer toes simulate the AI both using synthetic gen for synthetic data generation as well as a place where the AI robot the humano robot or the the manipulation robot could go learn how to uh refine its Ai and then of course the third AI is the computer that actually runs the AI so it's a threea three computer problem you know it's a three body problem and so it's incredibly comp it's incredibly complicated and we created three computers to do that and we made a video uh for you for you to enjoy uh understanding this the thing that that we've done here is this uh in every each one of these computers depending on whether you want to use the software stack the algorithms on top or just the Computing infrastructure just a processor for the robot or the functional safety operating system that runs on top of it or the AI and computer vision models that run on top of that or uh just the computer itself any piece is any layer of that stack is open uh for robotics uh developers we created a quick video let's take a look at that is that okay that sounds great the era of physical AI is here physical AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world will embody robots many will be humanoid robots developing these Advanced robots is complex requiring vast amounts of data and workload orchestration across diverse Computing infrastructures Nvidia is working to simplify and accelerate developer workflows with three Computing platforms Nvidia AI Omniverse and Jetson Thor plus generative AI enabled developer tools to accelerate project Groot a general humanoid robot Foundation model Nvidia researchers capture human demonstrations seeing the robot's hands in spatial overlay over the physical world they then use robokos a generative simulation framework integrated into Nvidia Isaac lab to produce a massive number of environments and layouts they increase their data size using mimic gen M which helps them generate large scale synthetic motion data sets based on the small number of original captures they train the Groot model on Nvidia dgx cloud with the combined real and synthetic data sets next they perform software in the loop testing in Isaac Sim and the cloud and Hardware in the loop validation on Jetson Thor before deploying the improved model to the real robots Nvidia osmo robotics Cloud compute orchestration service manages job assignment and scaling across distributed resources throughout the workflow together these Computing platforms are empowering developers worldwide to bring us into the age of physical AI powered humanoid robot you know you know what's amazing Lauren at this conference sigraph is where all of this technology comes together isn't that right everybody researchers of sigraph isn't that right so whether it's computer Graphics or simulation artificial intelligence robotics all of it comes right comes together right here at sigra and that's the reason why I think you should come to sigra from now on me yes I'm happy to I'm thrilled to you I I I took I took uh uh I want 100% of the world's Tech press should come to Cigar we can get behind that just drink a lot of water um uh I went and saw some of the art exhibits last night upstairs in the exhibition effort fantastic just really really cool loved the literal spam Bots whoever created that one go check it out um I was actually listening to the sigraph spotlight podcast before this if folks haven't listened I I really recommend it uh the special projects chair was interviewing a couple of Graphics Legends including David yam yeah and one of the things that David M talked about was archives and this is kind of an existential question for this crowd right but people are creating this really amazing digital media all these these computer Graphics you are accelerating it with your technology it changes so fast now how do you ensure that everything folks are building lives into the future file formats archives accessing all of this work in the future the robots will live on y I have no concern they're going to take over y right Y what about what about the art that people are creating this is this is the existential question but all this well one of the one of the one of the uh that's an excellent question and one of the one of the um the formats that we deeply believe in is open USD open USD is the first format that brings together multimodality from almost almost every single tool and allows it uh to interact to be composed together uh to uh go in and out of these Virtual Worlds and so you could bring in just about any format ideally over time into it uh at this conference we announced that URF the universal robotics data format is now compatible with or can be ingested into into um uh open USD and so one one format after another format uh we're going to bring uh everything into this one common one common language using standards is one of the best ways uh to uh allow content and data to uh be shared be allow everybody to collaborate on it and to lift forever for example HTML without HTML uh it would have been hard for all of these different content from around the world to be accessible to everybody and so in a lot of ways open USD is the HTML of Virtual Worlds and um uh we we've we've been a early promoter of it um uh there's uh amazing companies that have joined and many other companies joining and um my expectation is every single design tool in the world will be able to connect to open USD and once you connect to that virtual world uh you can collaborate with uh anybody with any other Tool uh anywhere and so just like we with HTML you said this content can live forever are you going to build a gensen AI that lives forever absolutely there's a gensen AI in fact just about everything that I've ever said everything that I've ever written and ever done uh will likely be ingested into one of these uh uh generative AI models and I'm I'm I'm hoping that that happens and then uh in the future you'll be able to prompt it and and hopefully something smart gets said so jent and the might to be uh running your earnings calls in the future I hope so that's that's the first thing that has to go that's the first thing it has to go to a bot Jensen thank you so much I think we're probably going to get kicked off stage soon but you'll be back shortly with Mark Zuckerberg and welcome to your first cig ladies and gentlemen Lauren good thank you thank you it's really great shatting again thank you everybody we'll be right back Video games have spectacular graphics, capable of transporting you to incredibly detailed cities, heart-racing battlegrounds, magical worlds, and breathtaking environments. While this may look like an old western train station and locomotive from Red Dead Redemption 2, it’s actually composed of 2.1 million vertices assembled into 3.5 million triangles with 976 colors and textures assigned to the various surfaces, all with a virtual sun illuminating the scene below.But perhaps the most impressive fact is that these vertices, textures, and lights are entirely composed of ones and zeroes that’s continuously being processed inside your computer’s graphics card or a video game console. So then, how does your computer take billions of ones and zeroes and turn it into realistic 3D graphics? Well, let’s jump right in.The video game graphics rendering pipeline has three key steps: Vertex Shading, Rasterization, and Fragment Shading. While additional steps are used in many modern video games, these three core steps have been used for decades in thousands of video games for both computers and consoles and are still the backbone of the video game graphics algorithm for pretty much every game you play.Let’s begin with the first step called vertex shading. The basic idea in this step is to take all the objects’ geometries and meshes in a 3D space and use the field of view of the camera to calculate where each object falls in a 2D window called the view screen, which is the 2D image that’s sent to the display. In this train station scene, there are 1,100 different models and the camera’s field of view sections off what the player sees, reducing the number of objects that need to be rendered to 600. Let’s focus on the locomotive as an example.Although this engine has rounded surfaces and some rather complex shapes, it’s actually assembled from 762 thousand flat triangles using 382 thousand vertices and 9 different materials or colors applied to the surfaces of the triangles. Conceptually, the entire train is moved as one piece onto the viewscreen, but actually, each of the train’s hundreds of thousands of vertices are moved one at a time. So, let’s focus on a single vertex. The process of moving a vertex, and by extension, the triangles and the train, from a 3D world onto a 2D view screen is done using 3 transformations. First moving a vertex from model space to world space, then from world space to camera space, and finally from the perspective field of view onto the view screen. To perform this transformation we use the X,Y, and Z coordinates of that vertex in modeling space, then the position, scale, and rotation of the model in world space, and finally the coordinates and rotation of the camera and its field of view. We plug all these numbers into different transformation matrices and multiply them together resulting in the X and Y values of the vertex on the view screen as well as a Z value or depth, which we’ll use later to determine object blocking. After three vertices of the train are transformed using similar matrix math, we get a single triangle moved onto the view screen. Then the rest of the 382 thousand vertices of the train and the 2.1 million vertices of all the 600 objects in the camera’s field of view undergo a similar set of transformations, thereby moving all 3.5 million triangles onto a 2D viewscreen. This is an incredible amount of matrix math, but GPUs in graphics cards and video game consoles are designed to be triangle mesh rendering monsters and thus have evolved over decades to handle millions of triangles every few milliseconds. For example, this GPU has 10,000ish cores designed to efficiently execute up to 35 trillion operations of 32-bit multiplication and addition every second, and, by distributing the vertex co-ordinates and transformation data among each of the cores, the GPU can easily render the scene resulting in 120 or more frames a second. Now that we have all the vertices moved onto a 2D plane, the next step is to use the 3 vertices of a single triangle and figure out which specific pixels on your display are covered by that triangle. This process is called rasterization.A 4K monitor or TV has a resolution of thirty-eight forty by twenty-one sixty, yielding around 8.3 million pixels. Using the X and Y coordinates of the vertices of a given triangle on the view screen, your GPU calculates where it falls within this massive grid and which of the pixels are covered by that particular triangle. Next, those pixels are shaded using the texture or color assigned to that triangle. Thus, with rasterization, we turn triangles into fragments which are groups of pixels that come from the same triangle and share the same texture or color. Then we move on to the next triangle and shade in the pixels that are covered by it and continue to do this for each of the 3.5 million triangles that were previously moved onto the viewscreen. By applying the Red Blue and Green color values of each triangle to the appropriate pixels, a 4K image is formed in the frame buffer and sent to the display. You’re probably wondering how we account for triangles that overlap or block other triangles. For example, the train is blocking the view of much of the train station. Additionally, the train has hundreds of thousands of triangles on its backside that are sent through the rendering pipeline, but obviously don’t appear in the final image. Determining which triangles are in front is called the visibility problem and is solved by using a Z-buffer or Depth Buffer. A Z-Buffer adds an extra value to each of the 8.3 million pixels corresponding to the distance or depth that each pixel is from the camera.In the previous step, when we did the vertex transformations, we ended up with X and Y coordinates, but then also got a Z value that corresponds to the distance from the transformed vertex to the camera. When a triangle is rasterized, it covers a set of pixels and the Z value or depth of the triangle is compared with the values stored in the Z-Buffer. If the triangle’s depth values are lower than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is closer to the camera, then we paint in those pixels using the triangle’s color and re-place the Z-buffer’s values using that triangle’s Z-values. However, let’s say a second triangle comes along with Z values that are higher than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is further away. We just throw it out and keep the pixels from the triangle that was previously painted with lower Z-values. Using this method, only the closest triangles to the camera with the lowest Z-values will be displayed on the screen. By the way, here’s the image of the Z or Depth buffer, wherein black is close and white is far. Note that because these triangles are in 3D space, the vertices often have 3 different Z values, and thus each individual pixel of the triangle needs its Z value computed using the vertex coordinates. This allows intersecting triangles to properly render out their intersections pixel by pixel. One issue with rasterization and these pixels is that if the triangle cuts at an angle and passes through the center of the pixel, then the entire pixel is painted with that triangle’s color resulting in jagged and pixelated edges.To reduce the appearance of these jagged edges, graphics processors implement a technique called Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing. With SSAA, 16 sampling points are distributed across a single pixel, and when a triangle cuts through a pixel, depending on how many of the 16 sampling points the triangle covers, a corresponding fractional shade of that color is applied to the pixel, resulting in faded edges in the image and significantly less noticeable pixelization.One thing to remember is that when you’re playing a video game, your character’s camera view as well as the objects in the scene are continuously moving around. As a result, the process and calculations within vertex shading, rasterization, and fragment shading are recalculated for every single frame once every 8.3 milliseconds for a game running at 120 frames a second.Let’s move onto the next step which is Fragment Shading. Now that we have a set of pixels corresponding to each triangle, it’s not enough to simply paint by number to color the pixels. Rather, to make the scene realistic, we have to account for the direction and strength of the light or illumination, the position of the camera, reflections, and shadows cast by other objects. Fragment shading is therefore used to shade in each pixel with accurate illumination to make the scene realistic. As a reminder, fragments are groups of pixels formed from a single rasterized triangle. Let’s see the fragment shader in action. This train engine is mostly made of black metal, and if we apply the same color to each of its pixel fragments, we get a horribly inaccurate train. But once we apply proper shading, such as making the bottom darker and the top lighter, and by adding in specular highlights or shininess where the light bounces off the surface, we get a realistic black metal train. Additionally, as the sun moves in the sky, the shading on the train reflects the passage of time throughout the day, and, if it’s night, the materials and colors of all the objects are darker and illuminated from the light of the fire. Even video games such as Super Mario 64 which is almost 30 years old have some simple shading where the colors of surfaces are changed by the lighting and shadows in the scene. So, let’s see how fragment shading works. The basic idea is that if a surface is pointing directly at a light source such as the sun, it’s shaded brighter whereas if a surface is facing perpendicular to, or away from the light, it’s shaded darker.In order to calculate a triangle’s shading, there are two key details we need to know. First, the direction of the light and second, the direction the triangle’s surface is facing. Let’s continue to use the locomotive as an example and paint it bright red instead of black. As you already know, this train is made of 762 thou-sand flat triangles, many of which face in different directions. The direction that an individual triangle is facing is called its surface normal, which is simply the direction perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, kind of like a flagpole sticking out of the ground. To calculate a triangle’s shading, we take the cosine of the angle or theta between the two directions. The cosine theta value is 1 when the surface is facing the light and when the surface is perpendicular to the light it’s 0. Next, we multiply cosine theta by the intensity of the light and then by the color of the material to get the properly shaded color of that triangle. This process adjusts the triangles’ RGB values and as a result, we get a range of lightness to darkness of a surface depending on how its individual triangles are facing the light. However, if the surface is perpendicular or facing away, we don’t want a cosine theta value of 0 or a negative number because this would result in a pitch-black surface. Therefore, we set the minimum to 0 and add in an ambient light intensity times the surface color, and adjust this ambient light so that it’s higher in daytime scenes, and closer to 0 at night. Finally, when there are multiple light sources in a scene, we perform this calculation multiple times with different light directions, and intensities and then add the individual contributions together. Having more than a few light sources is computationally intense for your GPU, and thus scenes limit the number of individual light sources and sometimes limit the range of influence for the lights so that triangles will ignore distant lights. The vector and matrix math used in rendering video game graphics is rather complicated, but luckily there’s a free and easy way to learn it and that’s with Brilliant.org. Brilliant is a multidisciplinary online interactive education platform and is the best way to learn math, computer science, and many other fields of science and engineering. Thus far we’ve been simplifying the math behind video game graphics considerably. For example, vectors are used to find the value of cosine theta between the direction of the light and the surface normal, and the GPU uses the dot product divided by the norm of the two vectors to calculate it. Additionally, we skipped a lot of detail when it came to 3D shapes and transformations from one coordinate system to another using matrices. Rather fittingly, Brilliant.org has entire courses on vector calculus, trigonometry, and 3D geometry, as well as courses on linear algebra and matrix math. All of which have direct applications to this video and are needed for you to fully understand graphics algorithms.Alternatively, if you’re all set with math, we recommend their course on Thinking in Code which will help you build a solid foundation on computational problem solving.Brilliant is offering a free 30-day trial with full access to their thousands of lessons.

The link is in the description below.Let’s get back to exploring fragment shading. One key problem with it is that the triangles within an object each have only a single normal, and thus each triangle will share the same color throughout the triangle’s surface. This is called flat shading and is rather unrealistic when viewed on curved surfaces such as the body of this steam engine.So, in order to produce smooth shading, instead of using surface normals, we use one normal for each vertex calculated using the average of the normals of the adjacent triangles. Next, we use a method called barycentric coordinates to produce a smooth gradient of normals across the surface of a triangle. Visually it’s like mixing 3 different colors across a triangle, but instead we’re using the three vertex normal directions. For a given fragment we take the center of each pixel and use the vertex normals and coordinates of the pre-rasterized triangle to calculate the barycentric normal of that particular pixel. Just like mixing the three colors across a triangle this pixel’s normal will be a proportional mix of the three vertex normals of the triangle. As a result, when a set of triangles is used to form a curved surface, each pixel will be part of a gradient of normals resulting in a gradient of angles facing the light with pixel-by-pixel coloring and smooth shad-ing across the surface. We want to say that this has been one of the most enjoyable videos to make simply because we love playing video games and seeing the algorithm that makes these incredible graphics has been a joy.

Thus far we’ve covered the core steps for the graphics rendering pipeline, however, there are many more steps and advanced topics. For example, you might be wondering where ray tracing and DLSS or deep learning super sampling fits into this pipeline. Ray tracing is predominately used to create highly detailed scenes with accurate lighting and reflections typically found in TV and movies and a single frame can take dozens of minutes or more to render. For video games, the primary visibility and shading of the objects are calculated using the graphics rendering pipeline we discussed, but in certain video games ray tracing is used to calculate shadows, reflections, and improved lighting. On the other hand, DLSS is an algorithm for taking a low resolution frame and upscaling it to a 4K frame using a convolution neural network. Therefore DLSS is executed after ray tracing and the graphics pipeline generates a low-resolution frame. One interesting note is that the latest generation of GPUs has 3 entirely separate architectures of computational resources or cores. CUDA or Shading cores execute the graphics rendering pipeline. Ray tracing cores are self-explanatory. And then DLSS is run on the Tensor cores. Therefore, when you’re playing a high-end video game with Ray Tracing and DLSS, your GPU utilizes all of its computational resources at the same time, allowing you to play 4K games and render frames in less than 10 milliseconds each. Whereas if you were to solely rely on the CUDA or shading cores, then a single frame would take around 50 milliseconds. With that in mind, Ray Tracing and DLSS are entirely different topics with their own equally complicated algorithms, and therefore we’re planning separate videos that will explore each of these topics in detail. Furthermore, when it comes to video game graphics, there are advanced topics such as Shadows, Reflections, UVs, Normal Maps and more. Therefore, we’re considering making an additional video on these advanced topics. If you’re interested in such a video let us know in the comments.

Thanks for watching to the end! ladies and gentlemen I have a very special guest but could I ask everybody to sit down we're about to get started my next my next guest I am so impressed by this person three reasons first reason is there are only a handful of entrepreneurs Founders that started a company that literally touched the lives of billions of people around the world as part of the social fabric invented services and a state-of-the-art Computing company two very few entrepreneurs Founders founded the company and led it to over a trillion dollars of value and three a College Dropout all three things simultaneously ladies and Gentlemen please help me welcome Mark Zuckerberg welcome Mark welcome to your first sigraph right can you believe this one of the pioneers of computing a driver of modern Computing and I had to invite him to sigraph so anyways marks it down it's great to have you here welcome thanks for flying down yeah know this will be fun I he been going for like five hours already or something well yeah sure this is sigraph you know this 90% phds And so so the thing that's really great about sigraph uh as you know this is this is the show of computer Graphics image processing artificial intelligence and Robotics combined and some of the some of the companies that over the years have demonstrated and revealed amazing things here from Disney Pixar Adobe epic games and of course you know Nvidia we've done a lot of work here this year uh we introduced 20 papers at the intersection of artificial intelligence and simulation so we're using artificial intelligence to do um help simulation uh be way larger scale way faster for example uh differentiable physics uh we're using simulation to create uh simulation environments for synthetic data generation for artificial intelligence and so these two areas is are really coming together um really proud of the work that we've done here at meta uh you guys have done amazing AI work I mean one of the things that that that I find amusing is is uh uh when the Press writes about how metas jumped into AI this last last couple of years um as if uh you know the the work that that fair has done uh remember we all use pytorch that comes out of meta uh the uh the work that you do in computer vision the work in uh language models real-time translation uh groundbreaking work I guess my first question for you is you know how do you see how do you see the uh uh the advances of generative AI ad meta today and how do you apply it to either enhance your operations or introduce new capabilities that you're offering yeah so oh a lot to unpack there first of all really happy to be here um you know meta has done a lot of work and has has been at sigra for you know eight years so I mean it's a you know we're noobs compared to to you guys but um you I think it was back in in 2018 you're dressed right but this is my hood I just want it's I mean well thank you for welcoming me to your hood um I think it was back in 2018 we we we showed the some of the early hand tracking work on um for our VR and mixed reality headsets um and I think we've talked a bunch about the progress that we're making on codec avatars the photorealistic um avatars that we want to be able to drive from consumer headsets which we're getting closer and closer to so pretty excited about that and also a lot of the display systems work that we've done so um some of the future prototypes and research for getting the mixed reality headsets to be able to be really thin with like with just um pretty Advanced Optical stacks and and display uh systems the the integrated system I that's that's been stuff that we've typically uh shown here first so um excited to be here uh you know this year not just talking about the metaverse stuff but but also um all the AI pieces which as you said I me we started Fair uh the the AI Research Center um at you know back then it was Facebook now meta uh before we started reality Labs I we've been at this for for a while um the you know all the stuff around gen it's it's an interesting Revolution and and and I think that it's going to it's going to end up making I think all of the different products that we do you know different and and in in interesting ways I mean I I kind of go through you can look at the big product lines that we have already so things like the you know feed and recommendation systems and Instagram and Facebook and we've kind of been on this journey where that's gone from just being about connecting with your friends and the ranking was always important because you even when you were just um you know following friends you know if someone did something really important like your cousin had a baby or something it's like you want that at the top you'd be pretty angry at us if we that was buried somewhere down in your feed um so the ranking was was important but now over the last few years it's gotten to a point where more of that stuff is um is just different public content that's out there the recommendation systems are super important because now instead of just a few hundred or thousand potential candidate posts from friends um there's millions of of of pieces of content and that turns into like a really interesting recommendation problem and with generative AI um I think we're going to quickly move into this Zone where not only is is the majority of the content that you see today on Instagram you know just recommended to you from kind of stuff that's out there in the world that matches your interests whether not you follow the people I think in the future a lot of the stuff is going to be created with these tools too some of that is going to be creators using the tools to create new content some of it I think eventually is going to be content that's either created on the Fly for you um or or or kind of pulled together and synthesize through different things that are out there so that that's just one example of how kind of the core part of what we're doing is just going to evolve and it's been evolving for for 20 years already but I think few people realize that that uh one of the largest Computing systems the world has ever conceived of a recommenders system yeah I mean it's this whole yeah it's this whole different path right it's it's not quite the kind of Genai hotness that people talk about but I think it's it's like as I mean it's all the Transformer architectures and it's a similar thing of just building up more more General models embeding embedding unstructured data into features and yeah I mean one of the big things that just drives quality improvements is you know it used to be that you'd have a different model for each type of content right so a recent example is you know we had you know one model for ranking and recommending reals and another model for ranking and recommending more long form videos and then you know take some product work to basically make it so that the system can display you know anything in line but you know the more you kind of just create more General recommendation models that can span everything it just gets better and better so I mean part of it I think is just like economics and liquidity of content and the broader of a pool that you can pull from you're you're just not having these weird inefficiencies of pulling from different pools but yeah mean as the models get bigger and more General that gets better and better so I I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being you know like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together that actually have different objectives over different time frames right because some of it is just showing you you know what's the interesting content that you're going to be that that you want to see today but some of it is helping you build out your network over the long term right people you may know accounts you might want to follow and these these multimodal models tend to be yeah tend to be much better at recognizing patterns weak signals and such and so one of the things that people people always you know it's so interesting that AI has been so deep in your company you've been building GPU infrastructure running these large recommender systems for a long time now you're now you're a little slow on it actually getting to gpus yeah I was trying to be nice I know well you know too nice I was trying to be nice you know my gu when I was backstage before I came on here you were talking about like owning your mistakes or something right so you don't have to volunteer it out of the blue I I think this one has been well tried it's like I got breaked over the but as soon as you got into it as soon as you got into it you got into it strong let's just put it there you go there you go now now now the thing that's really cool about about generative AI is is these days when I use WhatsApp I feel like I'm collaborating with what'sapp I love imagine I'm sitting you're typing and it's generating the images as I'm going I go back and I change my words it's generating other images yeah you know and and so the one that that o old Chinese guy uh enjoying a glass of whiskey at sundown with three dogs golden retriever golden doodle and a bernes mountain dog and it generates you know a pretty good looking pict yeah yeah we're we're getting there every month getting better and then now you could actually load my picture in there actually be me yeah that's as of last week yeah yeah super excited about that now imagine me I know I'm spending a lot of time with my daughters imagining them as mermaids and things over the last um over the last week it's been it's been a lot of fun but yeah I mean that's that's the other half of it I mean the a lot of the Gen stuff is going to on the one hand it's I think going to just be this big upgrade for all of the workflows and products that we've had for a long time but on the other hand there's going to be all these completely new things things that can now get created So Meta AI um you know the idea of having you know just an an AI assistant that can help you with different tasks and um in in our world is going to be you know very creatively oriented like you're saying but um but I mean they're very general so I you don't need to just constrain it to that it'll be able to answer any question um over time I think you know when we move from like the Llama 3 class of models to llama 4 and Beyond it's um it's going to I think feel less like a chat box where it's like you you give it a a a prompt and it just responds then you give it a prompt and it responds and it's just like back and forth I think it's going to pretty quickly evolve to you give it an intent and it actually can go away on multiple time frames and I mean it probably should acknowledge that you gave it an intent up front but I mean you know some of the stuff I think will end up you know it'll spin up you know compute jobs that take you know weeks or months or something then just come back to you when like something happens in the world and I think that that's going to be really powerful so I mean today's AI as you as you know is kind of turnbas you say something it says something back to you um but obviously when we think when we're given a mission or we're giving a problem you know we we'll contemplate multiple options or maybe we come up with a you know a tree of options a decision tree and we walk down to the decision tree simulating in our mind you know what are the different outcomes of each decision that we could potentially make and so we we're doing planning and so in the the future AIS will will kind of do the same one of the things that that I was super excited about when you talked about your vision of Creator AI I just think that's that's a home run idea frankly tell everybody about the Creator Ai and AI Studio that's going to enable you to do that yeah so so we actually I mean this is something that we're we're you know we've talked about it a bit but we're rolling it out a lot wider today um you know a lot of our vision is that I don't think that there's just going to be like one AI model right I mean this is something that some of the other companies in the industry they're like you know it's like they're building like one Central agent and and yeah we we'll have the metai assistant that you can use but a lot of our vision is that we want to empower all the people who use our products to basically create agents for themselves whether that's you know all the many many millions of creators that are on the platform or you know hundreds of millions of small businesses um we eventually want to just be able to pull in all your content and very quickly stand up a business agent and um be able to interact with your customers and you know do sales and customer support and all that so the one that we're that we're just starting to roll out more now is um we call it AI studio and it basically is um a set of tools that eventually is going to make it so that every Creator can build sort of an AI version of themselves um as as sort of an an agent or an assistant that that their Community can interact with there's kind of a fundamental issue here where there's there's just not enough hours in the day right it's like if you're if you're a Creator you want to engage more with your community um but you you you're constrained on time and similarly your community wants to engage with you uh but it's tough I mean there's there's just there's a limited time to do that so the next best thing is is allowing people to basically create these artifacts right it's um it's sort of it's an agent but it's you train it to kind of on on your material um to represent you in the way that you want I think it it's it's a very kind of creative Endeavor almost like a like a piece of of art or content that you're putting out there and know it's it's going to be very clear that it's not engaging with the Creator themselves but I think it'll be another interesting way just like how creators put out content on on these um social systems to be able to have agents that do that similarly I think that there's going to be a thing where people basically create their own agents for all different kinds of uses some will be sort of customized utility things that they're trying to get done that they want to kind of fine-tune and and train an agent for some of will be entertainment and some of the things that people create are just funny you know and just kind of silly in different ways or or kind of have a funny attitude about things that um you know we probably couldn't we probably wouldn't build into meta AI as an assistant but but I think people um people are are kind of pretty interested to see um and interact with and then one of the interesting use cases that we're seeing is people kind of using these agents for support um this was one thing that that was a little bit surp surprising to me is one of the top use cases for meta AI already is people basically using it to roleplay difficult social situations that they're going to be in so whether it's a professional situation it's like all right I want to ask my manager like how do I get a promotion or raise or I'm having this fight with my friend or I'm having this difficult situation with my girlfriend like how like how can this conversation go and basically having a like a completely judgment free zone where you can basically roleplay that and see how how how the conversation will go and and get feedback on it um but a lot of people they don't just want to interact with the same kind of you know agent whether it's met AI or chat GPT or whatever it is that everyone else is using they want to kind of create their own thing so that's that's roughly where we're going with AI Studio but it's all part of this bigger I I guess view that we have that there shouldn't just be kind of one big AI that people interact with we we we just think that the world will be better and more if there's a diversity of these different things I just think it's so cool that if you're an artist and you have a style you could take your style all of your body of work you could fine-tune yeah one of your models yeah and now this becomes an AI model that you can come and you could prompt it you could ask me to uh you know create something along the lines of the art style that I have and you might even give me a piece of art as a make a drawing a sketch as an inspiration and I can generate something for you and it's and you come to my come to my uh uh you know come to my bot for that come to my AI for that it could be it could be a uh every single uh every single restaurant every single website will probably in the future have these AIS yeah I mean I I kind of think that in the future just like every business has you know an email address and a website and a social media account or several I think in the future every business is going to have an AI agent that interfaces with their customers and some of these things I think have been pretty hard to do historically like um if you think about any company it's like you probably have customer support is just a separate organization from sales and that's not really how you'd want it to work as CEO it's just that okay they're kind of different skills you're building up these I'm your customer support just a what's up I'm your yeah well apparently I am yeah I mean whenever Mark needs something as CEO I can't tell whether it's chatbot or it's Mark but he it's just my chatbot just asking you um no well I guess that's kind of yeah when you're CEO you have to do all the stuff but but I mean then when you build the abstraction into your organization a lot of times like the you know in general the organizations are separate because they're kind of optimized for different things but I think like the platonic ideal of this would be that it's kind of one thing right as a you know as a customer you don't really care you know you don't want to like have a different route when you're trying to buy something versus if you're having an issue with something that you bought you just want to have a place that you can go and get your questions answered and be able to um engage with the business in different ways and I think that that applies for creators too I think that the the kind of personal consumer side of this is all that engagement with your customers especially if their complaints is going to make your company better yeah totally right the fact that it's all engaging with this AI is going to capture the the uh the institutional knowledge and how to and all of that can go into analytics which improves the AI and so on so forth yeah yeah so the business version of this is um that I think has a little more integration and we're still in in a pretty early Alpha that but the AI Studio making it so people can kind of create their ugc agents and and different things and getting started on this flywheel of having creators create them I'm I'm pretty excited about that and so can I can I use AI Studio to fine-tune with my images my collection of images yeah you're yeah we're going to get there okay and then I could could I give it load it all the things that I've written so that use it use it as my rag yeah yeah yeah basically okay and then every time I come back to it it loads up the it's memory again so it remembers where it left off last time yep and we carry on our conversation as as if nothing ever happened yeah and and and look I mean like any product it'll get better over time the tools for training it will get better it's not just about what you want it to say I mean I think generally creators and businesses have topics that they want to stay away from too right so just getting better at all this stuff um you know I think the platonic version of this is not just text right you you almost want to just be able to and this is sort of an intersection with some of the codec Avatar work that we're doing over time you want to basically be able to have almost like a video chat with with the um with the with the agent and I think we'll get there over time I don't think that this stuff is that far off but the um the flywheel is spinning really quickly so it's it's it's exciting um there is a lot of new stuff to build and I I think even if the progress on the foundation models kind of stopped now which I don't think it will I think we'd have like five years of product Innovation for the industry to basically figure out how to most effective use all the stuff that's gotten built so far but I actually just think the the kind of foundation models and the progress on the fundamental research is accelerating so um so that it's a it's a pretty wild time your vision of it's all it's all um you know you kind of made this happen so why thank you in the last conversation I I thank you yeah you know that you know we're CEOs we're we're delicate flowers we need a lot of back yeah we're we're pretty grizzled at this point I think we're we're the two kind of longest standing Founders in the industry right it's I mean it's true it's true it's true I just and your hair has gotten gray mine has just gotten longer mine's gotten gray yours gotten curly what's up it was always curly that's why I kept it short okay yeah I just if if I known it was going to take so long to succeed you never would have started no I would have dropped out of college just like you get a head start well that's a that's a good difference between our personalities I I think that these things you got a 12 year Head Start that's pretty good that's pretty good you know you're doing pretty well uh I'm gon to I'm going to be able to carry on let me just put it that way yes so so um I the the thing that I love about about um your vision of that everybody can have an AI that every business can have an AI in our company I want every engineer and every software developer to have an AI yeah and um or many AIS uh the thing that's that that I love about your vision is you also believe that everybody and every company should be able to make their own AI so you actually open sourced uh when you open source llama I thought that was great llama 2.1 by the way I I thought llama 2 was probably the biggest event in AI last year and the reason for that I I thought it was the h100 but you know it's a it's a chicken or the egg question that's a chicken or the egg yeah which came first the h100 no well llama 2 was was actually not the h100 yeah it was a100 yeah thank you and so so um uh but but the reason why I said was the biggest event was because when that came out it activated every company every Enterprise and every industry all of a sudden every Healthcare company was building AIS every company was building AI every large company small companies startups was were building AIS it made it possible for every researcher to be able to re-engage AI again because they have a starting point to do something with um and uh and then now uh 3.1 is out and the excitement just so you know uh you know we work together to to uh uh deploy uh 3.1 we're taking it out to the world's Enterprise and the excitement is just off the charts and and I I think it's going to enable all kinds of applications but tell tell me about your your open- Source philosophy where did I come from from and you know you open source pytorch yeah and that it is now the framework by which AI is done and and uh now you've open source llama 3.1 or llama uh there's a whole ecosystem built around it and so I think it's horrific but where did that all come from yeah so there's there's a bunch of history on on a lot of this I mean we've done a lot of Open Source work over time um I think part of it you know just bluntly is you know we got started after some of the other tech companies right in building out stuff like the distributed computing infrastructure and and the data centers and you know because of that by the time that we built that stuff it wasn't a competitive Advantage so we're like all right we might as well make this open and then we'll benefit from the from the ecosystem around that so we we had a bunch of projects like that I think the biggest one was probably open compute where we took our server designs the network designs and eventually the data center designs and published all of that and by having that become somewhat of an industry standard um all the supply chains basically got or organized around it which had this benefit of saving money for everyone so by making it public um and open we basically have saved billions of dollars from doing that work open compute was also what made it possible for NVIDIA hgx is that we design for one data center all a sudden Works in yeah Works in every data center awesome um so so we so that was an awesome experience and then you we've done it with a bunch of our kind of infrastructure tools things like react pie torch um so I'd say by the time that llama came around we were sort of positively predisposed towards doing this um for for AI models specifically I guess there's a few ways that I look at this I mean one is you know it's been really fun building stuff over the last 20 years at the company um one of the things that that has been sort of the most difficult has been kind of having to navigate the fact that we ship our apps through through our competitors mobile platforms so in the one hand the mobile platforms have been this huge Boon to the industry that's been awesome um on the other hand having to deliver your products through your competitors um is challenging right and and I also you know I grew up in a time where you know the first version of Facebook was on the web and that was open and then you know as it transitioned to mobile you know the plus side of that was you know now everyone has a computer in their pocket so that's great the downside is okay we're a lot more restricted in what we can do so when you look at these generation of computing there's this big recency bias where everyone just looks at mobile and thinks okay because the closed ecosystem because Apple basically won and set the the terms of that and like yeah I know that there's more Android phones out there technically but like apple basically has the whole Market um and and and like all the profits and and basically Android is kind of following Apple in terms of the development of it so I think Apple pretty clearly won this generation but it's not always like that right I me if you go back a generation um you Apple was doing their their kind of closed thing um but Microsoft which was you know it's it obviously isn't like this perfectly open company but you know compared to to to Apple with Windows running on all the different oems and different software uh and different different Hardware um was a much more open ecosystem and Windows Windows was the leading ecosystem it it um you know it it basically in the kind of PC generation of things the open ecosystem one and I am kind of hopeful that in the next generation of computing we're going to return to a Zone where the open ecosystem wins and is the leading one again there will always be a closed one and an open one I think that there's reasons to do both there are benefits to both I'm not like a zealot on this I mean we do closed Source stuff and not everything that we that we publish is open um but I think in general for the Computing platforms that the whole industry is building on there's a lot of value for that if the software especially is open so that's really shaped My Philosophy on this and um for both AI with llama and with the work that we're doing in AR and VR where we're basically making the Horizon OS that we're building for mixed reality um an an open operating system in the sense of of kind of what Android or or Windows was and and basically making it so that um like we're going to be able to work with lots of different Hardware companies to make all different kinds of of devices we basically just want to return the ecosystem to that level where that that's going to be the open one and and I I I'm pretty optimistic that the Next Generation the open ones are going to win for for us specifically um you know I just want to make sure that we have access to I mean this is sort of selfish but I mean it's you know after building this company for a while um one of my things for the next 10 or 15 years is like I just want to make sure that we can build the fundamental technology that we're going to be building social experiences on because there have just been too many things that I've tried to build and then have just been told nah you can't really Build That by the platform provider that at some level I'm just like nah that for the next Generation Um like we're going to go build like all all the way down and and make sure that that we there goes our broadcast opportunity yeah no sorry um sorry um like beep yeah you know we're doing okay for like 20 minutes but give me give me talking about closed platforms and I get angry um so um hey look it it is great I think it's a great world where where uh where there are people who are dedicated uh to build the best possible AI however they build it and they make they they offer it to the World um you know as a service and then but if you want to build your own AI you could still also build your own AI so the ability totally to right to use an AI you know there's a lot of stuff I prefer not to make this jacket myself I prefer to have this Jack made for me you know what I'm saying yeah yeah but so the fact that so the fact that leather could be open source is not a useful concept for me but but I I think the the idea that you could you could have great Services incredible Services as well as open Service open ability then then we basically have the entire Spectrum but the the thing that's that that that you did with 3.1 that was really great was you have 405b you have 70b you have 8B you could you could use it for synthetic data generation use the larger models to essentially teach the smaller models and although the larger models will be more General um it it's less brittle uh you could you could still build a smaller model that fits in you know whatever operating domain or operating cost that you would like to have uh you you uh uh met a guard I think llama guard llama guard for Guard railing fantastic um and so now and the way that that you built the model uh it's built in a transparent way it's uh has you dedicated you've got a world class safety team World Class ethics team uh you could build it in such a way that everybody knows it's built properly and so I really love that part of it yeah and I mean just to finish the thought from from before uh before I got I got Sidetrack there for detour um you know I do think there's this alignment where I we're building it because we want the thing to exist and we want to knock it cut off from some closed model right and um but it this isn't just like a piece of software that you can build it's you know you need an ecosystem around it and so it's it's almost like it it kind of almost wouldn't even work that well if we didn't open source it right it's it's not we're not doing this because we're kind of altruistic people um even though I I I think that this is going to be helpful for the ecosystem and we're doing it because we think that this is going to make the thing that we're building the best by by kind of having a robust ecosystem around how many people contributed to pytorch ecosystem yeah totally mountains of engineering yeah right yeah yeah Nvidia alone we probably have a couple of hundred people just dedicated to making P torch better and scalable and you know more performant and so on so forth yeah and it's it's also just when something becomes something of an industry standard other folks do work around it right so like all of the silicon and the systems will end up being optimized to run this thing really well which will benefit everyone but it will also work well with the system that we're building and that's I I think just one example of how this ends up being um just being really effective so yeah I mean I I think that the open source strategy is going to be is going to be a good one as a business strategy I I think people still don't quite get we we love it so much we built an ecosystem around it we built this thing called on this yeah yeah yeah you guys have been awesome on this I mean every time we're shipping something you guys are the first to to release this and and optimize it and make it work and so I mean I I appreciate that but what can what can I say we have good Engineers you know and so and and well you always just jump on the quickly too so well I you know I'm a I'm a senior citizen but I'm agile you know that's what CEOs have to do um and I recognize an important thing I recognize an important thing and and I I think that llama is genuinely important we built this concept to call an AI Factory uh AI Foundry around it uh so that we can help everybody build take you know a lot of people they they they have a desire to um uh uh build Ai and it's very important for them to own the AI because once they put put that into their their flywheel their data flywheel that's how their company's institutional knowledge is encoded and embedded into an an AI so they can't afford to have the AI flywheel the data flywheel that experienced flywheel somewhere else so and and so open source allows them to do that but they they don't really know how to turn this whole thing into an AI and so we created this thing called an AI Foundry we provide the tooling we provide the expertise uh llama uh technology uh we have the ability to help them uh turn this whole thing uh into an AI service and and then when when we're done with that uh they take it they own it we the output of it's what we call a Nim and this Nim this this neurom micro Nvidia inference micros Service uh they just download it they take it and they run it anywhere they like including on Prem and we have a whole ecosystem of Partners uh from oems that can run the NIMS to uh gsis like Accenture that that we've trained and work with to create llama based Nims and and uh and pipelines and and now we're we're off helping Enterprises all over the world do this I mean it's really quite an exciting thing it's really all triggered off of uh the Llama open sourcing yeah I think especially the ability to help people distill their own models from the big model is going to be a really valuable new thing because I I there's this you just like we talked about on the product side how at least I don't think that there's going to be like one major AI agent that everyone talks to it's at the same level I don't think that there's going to NE necessarily be one model that everyone uses we have a chip AI chip design AI we have a software coding Ai and our software coding AI understands uh USD because we code in USD for for Omniverse stuff um uh we have a software AI that understands verog our ver log um we have uh we have software AI that understands our bugs database and knows how to help us triage bugs and sends it to the right engineers and so each one of these AIS are fine-tuned off of llama and and so we find tune them we guardrail them you know if we if we have a if we have a an AI design for for uh for chip design uh we're not interested in asking it about politics you know and religion and things like that so we guardrail it and so so I think I think every company will essentially have for every single function that they have uh they will likely have AIS that are built for that and they need help to do that yeah I mean I think it's one of the big questions is going to be in the future to what extent are people just using the kind of the bigger more sophisticated models versus just training their own models for the uses that they have and at least I would bet that they are going to be just a a just vast proliferation of different models people we use the largest ones and the reason for that is because our Engineers are their times are so valuable and so we get uh right now we're getting 405b uh optimized for performance and as you know 405b doesn't fit in any GPU no matter how big and so that's why the MV link performance perance is so important we have this every one of our gpus connected by this nonblocking switch called MV link switch and um in the hgx for example there are two of those switches and we make it possible for all these all these gpus to work and and um uh run the 405 BS really performant the reason why we do it is because the the engineers times are so valuable to us you know we want to use the best possible model the fact that it's cost effective by a few pennies who cares and so we we we just want to make sure that the best qu quity of result is presented to them yeah well I mean the 405 I think is about half the cost to inference of the GPT 40 model so I mean at that level it's already I mean it's it's pretty good but yeah I mean I think people are doing stuff on devices or want smaller models they're just going to distill it down so that's like a whole different set of services that AI is running and let's let's pretend for a second that we're hiring that AI that AI for chip design is probably $10 an hour MH you're you're using you know and and uh uh um if you're using it constantly and you're sharing that AI across a whole bunch of Engineers so each engineer probably has an AI that's sitting sitting with them that cost you know doesn't cost very much and we pay the engineers a lot of money and so so to us a few dollars an hour uh amplifies the capabilities of somebody that's really valuable yeah yeah I mean you don't need to convince me if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't hired an AI do it right away that's all we're saying and so so um I I let's let's talk about let's talk about um the next the next wave um you know one of the things that I really love about the work that you guys do computer vision um uh one of the models that we use a lot internally uh is segment everything and um uh you know that that we're now train tring AI models on video so that we can understand the world model our use case our use cases for Robotics and and uh industrial industrial uh digitalization and um uh connecting these AI models into Omniverse so that we can we can um uh model and represent the physical world better uh have robots that operate in these Omniverse worlds better uh your your application uh uh the the Rayband metag glass um your vision for for bringing AI into the virtual world uh is really interesting tell us about that yeah well okay a lot to unpack in there um the segment anything model that that you're talking about we're actually presenting I think the next version of that here at at sigraph segment anything two um and it is it now works it's faster it works with um oh here we go um it works in video now as well I think the these are actually cattle from my Ranch in Kawaii um but by the way these are what they're called delicious delicious marks cows um there you go yeah another next time we do so Mark Mark came up to my house and we made Philly cheese steak together next time you're bringing the cow you did I was more of a sue Chef it was really good it was really good that suf comment okay listen and then at the end of the night though you were like hey so you you you ate enough right and I was like I don't know I could eat another one you're like really you know usually when you say something like you were being I was definitely like yeah we're making more we're making more she did you get enough to eat usually your guest says oh yeah that I'm fine make me another cheese steak Jensen so just to let you know how OCD he is so I turn around I'm I'm prepping the the the cheese steak and said Mark cut the tomatoes and so so Mark I handed him a knife yeah I'm I'm a Precision cutter and so he cuts he cuts the uh the tomatoes every single one of them are perfectly to the exact millimeter but the really interesting thing is I was expecting all the tomatoes to be sliced and kind of stacked up kind of like a a deck of cards and uh but when I turned around he said he needed another another plate and the reason for that was because all of the tomatoes he cut none of them touched each other once he separates one slice of tomato from The Other Tomato they shall not touch again yeah look man if you wanted them to touch you needed to tell me that right why I'm just the Sue Chef okay that's why he needs an AI that doesn't judge yeah it's like so this is super cool okay so it's recognizing the cows track it's recognizing tracking the cows yeah yeah so it's um a lot of fun effects will be able to be made with this and because it'll be open a lot of more serious applications across the industry too so I mean scientists use this stuff to you know study um like coral reefs and natural habitats and um and kind of evolution of Landscapes and things like that but I mean it's uh being able to do this in video and having it be zero shot and be able to kind of interact with it and tell it what you want to track is um it's it's it's pretty cool research so for example the reason why we use it uh for example you have a warehouse and it's got a whole bunch of cameras and the warehouse uh AI uh is watching everything that's going on and let's say a uh you know a stack of Boxes Fell uh or somebody spilled water on the ground um or you know what whatever accident is about to happen the AI recognizes it generates the text send it to somebody and you know uh you know help will come along the way and so that's one way of using it uh instead of recording everything if there's an accident and started recording every nanc a video and then going back and re retrieve that moment it just it just records the important stuff because it knows what it's looking at and so so having a vi video understanding model a video language model is really really powerful for all all these these interesting applications now what else what else are you guys going to work on Beyond uh Ray talk talk to me about yeah so there's all the smart glasses right so I think when we think about the next Computing platform you know we kind of break it down into mixed reality the headsets and the smart glasses and the smart glasses I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around that and wearing it because it's you know pretty much everyone who's wearing a pair of glasses today will end up that'll get upgraded to smart glasses and that's like more than a billion people in the world so that's going to be a pretty big thing um the VMR headsets I think some people find it interesting for gaming or different uses some don't yet my view is that they're going to be both in world I think the smart glasses are going to be sort of the mobile phone kind of always on version of the next Computing platform and the mixed reality headsets are going to be more like your workstation or your game console where when you're sitting down for a more immersive session and you want access to more compute I mean look I mean the glasses are just very small form factor um there going to be a lot of constraints on that just like you can't do the same level of computing on a phone came at exactly the time when all of these breakthroughs in generative AI happened yeah so we we basically for smart classes we've been we've been going at the problem from two different directions on the one hand we've been building what we think is sort of the technology that you need for the kind of Ideal holographic AR glasses and we're doing all the custom silicon work all the custom display stack work like all the stuff that you would need to do to make that work and they're glasses right it's not a headset it's not like a VR or Mr headset they look like glasses but um they're still quite a bit far off from the glasses that you're wearing now I mean those are very thin but um but even even the rayb bands that we that we make you couldn't quite fit all the tech that you need to into that yet for kind of full holographic AR though we're getting close and over the next few years I think we'll we'll basically get closer it'll still be pretty expensive but but I think that'll start to be a product um the other angle that we've come at this is let's start with good-look glasses by partnering with the Best glasses maker in the world es luoda they basically make they have all all the big brands that you use um you know with it's rayan or Oakley or Oliver pees or just like a handful of others kind of all L luoda the Nvidia of glasses um I I think that you know it's um I think they would probably like that analogy but um I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't at this point um but I so we've been working with them on on the rayb bands we're on the second generation and the goal there has been okay let's constrain the form factor to just something that looks great great idea and within that let's put in as much technology as we can understanding that we're not going to get to the kind of ideal of what we want to fit into it technically but it'll it'll but at the end it'll be like great looking glasses and we at this point we have we have camera sensors so you can you can take photos and videos you can actually live stream to Instagram you can take video calls on WhatsApp and stream to the other person um you know what you're seeing um you can I mean it has it has a microphone and speaker so I mean the speaker is actually really good it's open ear so you a lot of people find it more comfortable than than earbuds um you can listen to music and it's just like this private experience that's pretty neat people love that you take phone calls on it um but then it just turned out that that sensor package was exactly what you needed to be able to talk to AI too yeah so that was sort of an accident if you'd asked me five years ago were we gonna get holographic AR before AI I would have said yeah probably right I mean it's it just seems like kind of the graphics progression and the display progression on all the virtual and mixed reality stuff and building up the new display stack we were just making continual progress towards that that's right and then this breakthrough happened with llms and it turned out that we have sort of really high quality AI now and getting better at a really fast rate before you have holographic AR so it's sort of this inversion that that I didn't really expect I mean we're we're fortunately well positioned because we were working on all these different products but I think what you're going to end up with is um just a whole series of different potential glasses products at different price points with different levels of technology in them so I kind of think um based on what we're seeing now with the Rayband metas I I would guess that display AI glasses MH at like a $300 price point are going to be a really big product that like tens of millions of people or hundreds of millions of people eventually are going to have um and you're going to have super interactive AI that you're talking to you have visual you have visual language understanding that you just showed you have realtime translation you could talk to me in one language I hear it in another language yeah then the display is obviously going to be great too but it's going to add a little bit of weight to the glasses and it's going to make them more expensive so I think for there will be a lot of people who want the kind of full holographic display but there are also going to be a lot of people for whom um you know they they want something that eventually is going to be like really thin glasses and well for industrial applications and for some work applications we need that we need I think for Consumer stuff too you think so yeah I mean I I think you know it's I was thinking about this a lot during the you know during covid when when everyone kind of went remote for a bit it's like you're spending all this time on Zoom it's like okay this is like it's great that we have this but um but in the future we're like not that many years away from being able to have a virtual meeting where like you know it's like I'm not here physically it's just my hologram and like it just feels like we're there and we're physically present we can work on something and collaborate on something together but I think this is going to be especially important with AI I could live with with a a device that that I'm not wearing all the time oh yeah but I think we're going to get to the point where it actually is I could it'll be I mean there's with within glasses there's like thinner frames and there's thicker frames and there's like all these Styles but um so I don't I think we're we're a while away from having full holographic glasses in the form factor of your glasses but I think having it in a pair of stylish kind of chunkier framed glasses is not that far off these sunglasses are the face size these days I could see that yeah and and you know what that's that's a very helpful style track exactly that's a very helpful whoever you know it's like like I'm I'm trying to you know TR make my way into becoming like a style influencer so I can like influence this before um you know before the glasses come to the market but you know well I can see you attempting it how's your style influencing working out for you you know it's early yeah it's um it's early it's early um but I don't know I feel like if if if a big part of the future of the business is going to be building um kind of stylish glasses that people wear um this is something I should probably start paying a little more attention to right then we're going to have to retire the version of me that we're the same thing every day but I mean that's the thing about glasses too I I think it's um you know it's unlike you know even the watch or or phones like people really do not want to all look the same right and and it's like so I do think that it's you know it's it's a it's a platform that I think is going to lend itself going back to the theme that we talked about before towards being an open ecosystem because I think the diversity of form factors that people and styles that people are going to demand is going to be immense um it's not like everyone is not going to want to put like the one kind of pair of glasses that you know whoever else designs like that's not I don't think that's going to fly for this yeah I think that's right well Mark it's sort of incredible that we're living through a time where where the entire Computing stack is re being reinvented how we think about software you know what what Andre calls software one and software 2 and now we're basically in software 3 now the way we compute um from general purpose Computing to these generative neural network processing way of doing Computing um the capabilities the applications we could develop now are Unthinkable in the past and and this technology generative AI uh I don't remember another technology that that in such a fast rate influenced consumers Enterprise Industries and science yeah and to be able to to cut across cut across um all these different fields of science from from climate Tech to U biotech um uh to uh physical sciences uh in every single field that we're encountered uh generative AI is is right at the middle of that uh fundamental transition and and it's and and in addition to that uh the things that you're talking about generative AI is going to make a a profound impact in society you know the products that we're making and one of the things that I'm s super excited about and somebody asked me earlier is there going to be a you know gents and AI um well that's exactly the creative AI you were talking about you know where we just build our own AIS and I I load it up with all of the things that I've written and and I I fine-tune it with with uh uh with the way I answer questions and and uh and hopefully hopefully over time the accumulation of use and you know becomes a really really great assistant and companion for for uh uh for a whole lot of people who just wants to you know ask questions or um bounce ideas off of and and it'll be the version of Jensen that as as you were saying earlier that's that's not judgmental you're not afraid of being judged and so you could come and interact with it all the time but but I I just think I think that th those are real really incredible things and and you know we we write we write a lot of things all the time and and how incredible is it just to give it you know three or four topics these are the basic themes of what I want to write about and write it in my voice and just use that as a starting point so there's there's just so many things that we can do now uh it it's really terrific working with you and uh uh I I know that I know that uh it's not easy building a company and you pivoted yours from desktop to mobile to VR to AI all these devices uh it's really really really extraordinary to watch and Nvidia pivoted many times ourselves and I know exactly how hard it is doing that and uh um you know both of us have have gotone kicked in our teeth a lot plenty over the years but that's that's what it takes to to uh uh to want to be a Pioneer and and innovate so it's really great watching you well and likewise I mean it's like it's I'm not sure if it's a pivot if you keep doing the thing you were doing before but but is as well but it's but you add to it I mean there's more chapters to all the to to all this and I think the same thing for it's been fun watching I me the journey that you guys have been on I mean just and you went we went through this period where everyone was like nah everything is going to kind of move to these devices and you know just going to get super kind of cheap compute and and you guys just kept on plugging away at this and it's like no like actually you're going to want these big systems that can that can paralyze we went the other way yeah no and it's I mean yeah we went and instead of building smaller and smaller devices we make computers as size unfashionable for a while a little unfashionable super unfashionable yeah yeah but now now it's cool and and instead of in you know we started building a graphics chip a GPU and and now when you when uh when you're deploying a GPU you still call it Hopper h100 but so you guys know when when when Zuck calls it h100 his data center of h100s there's like I think you're coming up on 600,000 and and they're we're good customers that's how you get the Jensen Q&A at sigraph wow hang on that I was getting the Mark Zuckerberg Q&A you were my guest and I wanted to make sure that that you just called me one day and you're like hey yeah you know in like a couple of weeks we're doing this thing at sigar I'm like yeah I don't think I'm doing anything that day to Denver it sounds fun exactly I'm not doing anything that afternoon you showed up and and uh but but the thing the thing is just incredible these these systems that you guys build uh they're they giant systems incredibly hard to orchestrate incredibly hard to to run and you know you said that that you got into the GPU uh Journey later than than most but you're operating larger than just about anybody and it's it's incredible to watch and congratulations on everything that you've done and uh you you are quite the style icon now check check out this guy huh early stage working on it working on it it's a ladies and gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg thank you hang on hang on well um you know you know um so turns out the last time that we got together after dinner Mark Mark and I I where Jersey swap Jersey Swap and and uh we took a picture and and turned in it turned into something viral and um and now I thought that he he has no trouble wearing my jacket I don't know is that my look I don't think I can should be it should be is that right yeah I actually I um I made one for you you did

next time I see you I'm bring you a gold chain so fair is fair so I let you know I I was telling everybody that Lori bought me a new jacket to celebrate this year's sigraph sigraph is is a big thing in our company as you could imagine RTX was launched here amazing things were launched here and this is a brand new jacket it's literally 2 hours old wow and so I think we had a jersey swap again all right well this one's yours I mean this is worth more cuz it's used let's see I don't know I don't I think I think Mark is pretty buff he's the guy's pretty jacked I mean you too man all right all

second while running video games with incredibly realistic graphics? Maybe 100 million? Well, 100 million calculations a second is what’s required to run Mario 64 from 1996\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We need more power\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Maybe 100 billion calculations a second? Well, then you would have a computer that could run Minecraft back in 2011\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  In order to run the most realistic video games such as Cyberpunk 2077 you need a graphics card that can perform around 36 trillion calculations a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This is an unimaginably large number, so let’s take a second to try to conceptualize it\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Imagine doing a long multiplication problem once every second\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Now let’s say everyone on the planet does a similar type of calculation but with different numbers\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  To reach the equivalent computational power of this graphics card and its 36 trillion calculations a second we would need about 4,400 Earths filled with people, all working together and completing one calculation each every second\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It’s rather mind boggling to think that a device can manage all these calculations, so in this video we’ll see how graphics cards work in two parts\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  First, we’ll open up this graphics card and explore the different components inside, as well as the physical design and architecture of the GPU or graphics processing unit\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Second, we’ll explore the computational architecture and see how GPUs process mountains of data, and why they’re ideal for running video game graphics, Bitcoin mining, neural networks and AI\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: So, stick around and let’s jump right in\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  This video is sponsored by Micron which manufactures the graphics memory inside this graphics card\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: Before we dive into all the parts of the GPU, let’s first understand the differences between GPUs and CPUs\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Inside this graphics card, the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU has over 10,000 cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  However, when we look at the CPU or Central Processing Unit that’s mounted to the motherboard, we find an integrated circuit or chip with only 24 cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So, which one is more powerful? 10 thousand is a lot more than 24, so you would think the GPU is more powerful, however, it’s more complicated than that\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  A useful analogy is to think of a GPU as a massive cargo ship and a CPU as a jumbo jet airplane\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The amount of cargo capacity is the amount of calculations and data that can be processed, and the speed of the ship or airplane is the rate at which how quickly those calculations and data are being processed\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Essentially, it’s a trade-off between a massive number of calculations that are executed at a slower rate versus a few calculations that can be performed at a much faster rate\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: Another key difference is that airplanes are a lot more flexible since they can carry passengers, packages, or containers and can take off and land at any one of tens of thousands of airports\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Likewise CPUs are flexible in that they can run a variety of programs and instructions\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  However, giant cargo ships carry only containers with bulk contents inside and are limited to traveling between ports\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Similarly, GPUs are a lot less flexible than CPUs and can only run simple instructions like basic arithmetic\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally GPUs can’t run operating systems or interface with input devices or networks\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This analogy isn’t perfect, but it helps to answer the question of “which is faster, a CPU or a GPU?�\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Essentially if you want to perform a set of calculations across mountains of data, then a GPU will be faster at completing the task\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  However, if you have a lot less data that needs to be evaluated quickly than a CPU will be faster\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Furthermore, if you need to run an operating system or support network connections and a wide range of different applications and hardware, then you’ll want a CPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We’re planning a separate video on CPU architecture, so make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss it, but let’s now dive into this graphics card and see how it works\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  In the center of this graphics card is the printed circuit board or PCB, with all the various components mounted on it, [Animator Note: Highlight and list out the various parts that will be covered\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: ] and we’ll start by exploring the brains which is the graphics processing unit or GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  When we open it up, we find a large chip or die named GA102 built from 28\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 3 billion transistors\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The majority of the area of the chip is taken up by the processing cores which have a hierarchical organization\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Specifically, the chip is divided into 7 Graphics Processing Clusters or GPCs, and within each processing cluster are 12 streaming multiprocessors or SMs\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Next, inside each of these streaming multiprocessors are 4 warps and 1 ray tracing core, and then, inside each warp are 32 Cuda or shading cores and 1 tensor core\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Across the entire GPU are 10752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor Cores, and 84 Ray Tracing Cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  These three types of cores execute all the calculations of the GPU, and each has a different function\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  CUDA cores can be thought of as simple binary calculators with an addition button, a multiply button and a few others, and are used the most when running video games\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Tensor cores are matrix multiplication and addition calculators and are used for geometric transformations and working with neural networks and AI\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  And ray tracing cores are the largest but the fewest and are used to execute ray tracing algorithms\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Now that we understand the computational resources inside this chip, one rather interesting fact is that the 3080, 3090, 3080 ti, and 3090 ti graphics cards all use the same GA102 chip design for their GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This might be counterintuitive because they have different prices and were released in different years, but it’s true\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  So, why is this? Well, during the manufacturing process sometimes patterning errors, dust particles, or other manufacturing issues cause damage and create defective areas of the circuit\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Instead of throwing out the entire chip because of a small defect, engineers find the defective region and permanently isolate and deactivate the nearby circuitry\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  By having a GPU with a highly repetitive design, a small defect in one core only damages that particular streaming multiprocessor circuit and doesn’t affect the other areas of the chip\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  As a result, these chips are tested and categorized or binned according to the number of defects\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  The 3090ti graphics cards have flawless GA102 chips with all 10752 CUDA cores working properly, the 3090 has 10,496 cores working, the 3080ti has 10,240 and the 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores working, which is equivalent to having 16 damaged and deactivated streaming multiprocessors\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally, different graphics cards differ by their maximum clock speed and the quantity and generation of graphics memory that supports the GPU, which we’ll explore in a little bit\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Because we’ve been focusing on the physical architecture of this GA102 GPU chip, let’s zoom into one of these CUDA cores and see what it looks like\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Inside this simple calculator is a layout of approximately 410 thousand transistors\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This section of 50 thousand transistors performs the operation of A times B plus C which is called fused multiply and add or FMA and is the most common operation performed by graphics cards\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Half of the CUDA cores execute FMA using 32-bit floating-point numbers, which is essentially scientific notation, and the other half of the cores use either 32-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Other sections of this core accommodate negative numbers and perform other simple functions like bit-shifting and bit masking as well as collecting and queueing the incoming instructions and operands, and then accumulating and outputting the results\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a result, this single core is just a simple calculator with a limited number of functions\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This calculator completes one multiply and one add operation each clock cycle and therefore with this 3090 graphics cards and its 10496 cores and 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 7 gigahertz clock, we get 35\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 6 trillion calculations a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  However, if you’re wondering how the GPU handles more complicated operations like division, square root, and trigonometric functions, well, these calculator operations are performed by the special function units which are far fewer as only 4 of them can be found in each streaming multiprocessor\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Now that we have an understanding of what’s inside a single core, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other sections of the GA102 chip\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Around the edge we find 12 graphics memory controllers, the NVLink Controllers and the PCIe interface\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  On the bottom is a 6-megabyte Level 2 SRAM Memory Cache, and here’s the Gigathread Engine which manages all the graphics processing clusters and streaming multiprocessors inside\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Now that we’ve explored this GA102 GPU’s physical architecture, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other parts inside the graphics card\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  On this side are the various ports for the displays to be plugged into, on the other side is the incoming 12 Volt power connector, and then here are the PCIe pins that plug into the motherboard\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  On the PCB, the majority of the smaller components constitute the voltage regulator module which takes the incoming 12 volts and converts it to one point one volts and supplies hundreds of watts of power to the GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Because all this power heats up the GPU, most of the weight of the graphics card is in the form of a heat sink with 4 heat pipes that carry heat from the GPU and memory chips to the radiator fins where fans then help to remove the heat\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Perhaps some of the most important components, aside from the GPU, are the 24 gigabytes of graphics memory chips which are technically called GDDR6X SDRAM and were manufactured by Micron which is the sponsor of this video\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Whenever you start up a video game or wait for a loading screen, the time it takes to load is mostly spent moving all the 3D models of a particular scene or environment from the solid-state drive into these graphics memory chips\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  As mentioned earlier, the GPU has a small amount of data storage in its 6-megabyte shared Level 2 cache which can hold the equivalent of about this much of the video game’s environment\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Therefore in order to render a video game, different chunks of scene are continuously being transferred between the graphics memory and the GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Because the cores are constantly performing tens of trillions of calculations a second, GPUs are data hungry machines and need to be continuously fed terabytes upon terabytes of data, and thus these graphics memory chips are designed kind of like multiple cranes loading a cargo ship at the same time\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Specifically, these 24 chips transfer a combined 384 bits at a time, which is called the bus width and the total data that can be transferred, or the bandwidth is about 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 15 terabytes a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  In contrast the sticks of DRAM that support the CPU only have a 64-bit bus width and a maximum bandwidth closer to 64 gigabytes a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  One rather interesting thing is that you may think that computers only work using binary ones and zeros\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  However, in order to increase data transfer rates, GDDR6X and the latest graphics memory, GDDR7 send and receive data across the bus wires using multiple voltage levels beyond just 0 and 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  For example, GDDR7 uses 3 different encoding schemes to combine binary bits into ternary digits or PAM-3 symbols with voltages of 0, 1, and negative 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Here’s the encoding scheme on how 3 binary bits are encoded into 2 ternary digits and this scheme is combined with an 11 bit to 7 ternary digit encoding scheme resulting in sending 276 binary bits using only 176 ternary digits\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The previous generation, GDDR6X, which is the memory in this 3090 graphics card, used a different encoding scheme, called PAM-4, to send 2 bits of data using 4 different voltage levels, however, engineers and the graphics memory industry agreed to switch to PAM-3 for future generations of graphics chips in order to reduce encoder complexity, improve the signal to noise ratio, and improve power efficiency\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Micron delivers consistent innovation to push the boundaries on how much data can be transferred every second and to design cutting edge memory chips\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Another advancement by Micron is the development of HBM, or the high bandwidth memory, that surrounds AI chips\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  HBM is built from stacks of DRAM memory chips and uses TSVs or through silicon vias, to connect this stack into a single chip, essentially forming a cube of AI memory\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  For the latest generation of high bandwidth memory, which is HBM3E, a single cube can have up to 24 to 36 gigabytes of memory, thus yielding 192 gigabytes of high-speed memory around the AI chip\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next time you buy an AI accelerator system, make sure it uses Micron’s HBM3E which uses 30% less power than the competitive products\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  However, unless you’re building an AI data center, you’re likely not in the market to buy one of these systems which cost between 25 to 40 thousand dollars and are on backorder for a few years\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  If you’re curious about high bandwidth memory, or Micron’s next generation of graphics memory take a look at one of these links in the description\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Alternatively, if designing the next generation of memory chips interests you, Micron is always looking for talented scientists and engineers to help innovate on cutting edge chips and you can find out more about working for Micron using this link\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Now that we’ve explored many of the physical components inside this graphics card and GPU, let’s next explore the computational architecture and see how applications like video game graphics and bitcoin mining run what’s called “embarrassingly� parallel operations\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Although it may sound like a silly name, embarrassingly parallel is actually a technical classification of computer problems where little or no effort is needed to divide the problem into parallel tasks, and video game rendering and bitcoin mining easily fall into this category\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Essentially, GPUs solve embarrassingly parallel problems using a principle called SIMD, which stands for single instruction multiple data where the same instructions or steps are repeated across thousands to millions of different numbers\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Let’s see an example of how SIMD or single instruction multiple data is used to create this 3D video game environment\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As you may know already, this cowboy hat on the table is composed of approximately 28 thousand triangles built by connecting together around 14,000 vertices, each with X, Y, and Z coordinates\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  These vertex coordinates are built using a coordinate system called model space with the origin of 0,0,0 being at the center of the hat\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: To build a 3D world we place hundreds of objects, each with their own model space into the world environment and, in order for the camera to be able to tell where each object is relative to other objects, we have to convert or transform all the vertices from each separate model space into the shared world coordinate system or world space\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  So, as an example, how do we convert the 14 thousand vertices of the cowboy hat from model space into world space? Well, we use a single instruction which adds the position of the origin of the hat in world space to the corresponding X,Y, and Z coordinate of a single vertex in model space\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next we copy this instruction to multiple data, which is all the remaining X,Y, and Z coordinates of the other thousands of vertices that are used to build the hat\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next, we do the same for the table and the rest of the hundreds of other objects in the scene, each time using the same instructions but with the different objects’ coordinates in world space, and each objects’ thousands of vertices in model space\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a result, all the vertices and triangles of all the objects are converted to a common world space coordinate system and the camera can now determine which objects are in front and which are behind\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This example illustrates the power of SIMD or single instruction multiple data and how a single instruction is applied to 5,629 different objects with a total of 8\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 3 million vertices within the scene resulting in 25 million addition calculations\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The key to SIMD and embarrassingly parallel programs is that every one of these millions of calculations has no dependency on any other calculation, and thus all these calculations can be distributed to the thousands of cores of the GPU and completed in parallel with one another\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It's important to note that vertex transformation from model space to world space is just one of the first steps of a rather complicated video game graphics rendering pipeline and we have a separate video that delves deeper into each of these other steps\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Also, we skipped over the transformations for the rotation and scale of each object, but factoring in these values is a similar process that requires additional SIMD calculations\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Now that we have a simple understanding of SIMD, let’s discuss how this computational architecture matches up with the physical architecture\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Essentially, each instruction is completed by a thread and this thread is matched to a single CUDA core\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Threads are bundled into groups of 32 called warps, and the same sequence of instructions is issued to all the threads in a warp\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next warps are grouped into thread blocks which are handled by the streaming multiprocessor\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  And then finally thread blocks are grouped into grids, which are computed across the overall GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  All these computations are managed or scheduled by the Gigathread Engine, which efficiently maps thread blocks to the available streaming multiprocessors\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  One important distinction is that within SIMD architecture, all 32 threads in a warp follow the same instructions and are in lockstep with each other, kind of like a phalanx of soldiers moving together\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This lock step execution applied to GPUs up until around 2016\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  However, newer GPUs follow a SIMT architecture or single instruction multiple threads\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The difference between SIMD and SIMT is that while both send the same set of instructions to each thread, with SIMT, the individual threads don’t need to be in lockstep with each other and can progress at different rates\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  In technical jargon, each thread is given its own program counter\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally, with SIMT all the threads within a streaming multiprocessor use a shared 128 kilobyte L1 cache and thus data that’s output by one thread can be subsequently used by a separate thread\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This improvement from SIMD to SIMT allows for more flexibility when encountering warp divergence via data-dependent conditional branching and easier reconvergence for the threads to reach the barrier synchronization\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Essentially newer architectures of GPUs are more flexible and efficient especially when encountering branches in code\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  One additional note is that although you may think that the term warp is derived from warp drives, it actually comes from weaving and specifically the Jacquard Loom\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This loom from 1804 used programmable punch cards to select specific threads out of a set to weave together intricate patterns\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As fascinating as looms are, let’s move on\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The final topics we’ll explore are bitcoin mining, tensor cores and neural networks\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  But first we’d like to ask you to ‘like’ this video, write a quick comment below, share it with a colleague, friend or on social media, and subscribe if you haven’t already\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  The dream of Branch Education is to make free and accessible, visually engaging educational videos that dive deeply into

Well, GPUs ran thousands of iterations of the SHA-256 algorithm with the same transactions, timestamp, other data, but, with different nonce values\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a result, a graphics card like this one could generate around 95 million SHA-256 hashes or 95 million randomly numbered lottery tickets every second, and hopefully one of those lottery numbers would have the first 80 digits as all zeros\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  However, nowadays computers filled with ASICs or application specific integrated circuits perform 250 trillion hashes a second or the equivalent of 2600 graphics cards, thereby making graphics cards look like a spoon when mining bitcoin next to an excavator that is an asic mining computer\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Let’s next discuss the design of the tensor cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  It’ll take multiple full-length videos to cover generative AI, and neural networks, so we’ll focus on the exact matrix math that tensor cores solve\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Essentially, tensor cores take three matrices and multiply the first two, add in the third and then output the result\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Let’s look at one value of the output\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This value is equal to the sum of values of the first row of the first matrix multiplied by the values from the first column of the second matrix, and then the corresponding value of the third matrix is added in\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Because all the values of the 3 input matrices are ready at the same time, the tensor cores complete all of the matrix multiplication and addition calculations concurrently\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Neural Networks and generative AI require trillions to quadrillions of matrix multiplication and addition operations and typically uses much larger matrices\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Finally, there are Ray Tracing Cores which we explored in a separate video that’s already been released\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  That’s pretty much it for graphics cards\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  We’re thankful to all our Patreon and YouTube

proving the power of gpus for large scale simulations from everyone at Nvidia congratulations Professor caufman on this well-deserved recognition your pioneering contributions exemplify the spirit of progress that drives the field forward as a result of this groundbreaking work accelerated Computing has become the technology of choice for supercomputing this chart shows the history of accelerated and unaccelerated supercomputers among the top 100 fastest systems in the world in The Last 5 Years the number of accelerated systems has increased by 8 systems per year and increased from 33% to over 70% of the top 100 our goal is to help the world accelerate every workload it is certainly ambitious given the wide range of programming languages breath of developer experience and needs and ongoing emerging algorithms and techniques to support our developer community and meet them where they are today we offer over 450 libraries many which are tailored to specific domains an Ever evolving developer landscape take python for example warp is our pythonic framework for building and accelerating data generation and spatial Computing most physics based simulators in HBC engage in some form of spatial Computing whether it in quantum chemistry climate modeling or fluid dynamics all of which operate in 3D space and by expressing these calculations and warp they can be automatically differentiated and integrated into AI workflows one of the most most popular python libraries that exist today is numpy numpy is the foundation library for mathematical Computing for python developers it's used by over 5 million scientific and Industrial developers with 300 million downloads just last month over 32,000 GitHub applications use numpy in important science domains like astronomy physics signal processing and many others however as scientists look to scale their applications to use large HPC clusters they often need to use lower level distributed computing libraries like open MPI but what if you didn't what if your numpy program could just automatically paralyze across a GPU cluster without having to rewrite the Python program into a different supercomputing application today we're announcing Cai numeric a dropin replacement for the numpy library with cpai numeric researchers can write in Python and easily scale their work without needing expert in distributed computing Cai numeric automatically distributes the data across a GPU cluster using standard numpy data types powered by nvidia's latest communication and math libraries the results are incredible the research team at slack is using coupon numeric to analyze terabytes of data from the lcls x-ray laser which fires 120 shots per second during a 60-hour beam time they achieved a 6X speed up in data analysis allowing to make realtime decisions and uncover material properties this acceleration has reduced their analysis time before publication from 3 years to only 6 months early adopters for cpai numeric include Stanford University Center for turbulence research working on computational fluid Dynamic solvers Los Almos National Laboratory scaling ml algorithms for the Vado supercomputer and the University of Massachusetts Boston studying the entripy production rate in a microscopy Imaging experiment one of the highest honors at supercomputing is the Gordon Bell prize recognizing exceptional achievements in high performance Computing today we celebrate five finalist teams whose groundbreaking research leverages nvidia's accelerated systems across diverse Fields including molecular Dynamics protein design genomics and climate modeling JPI Barka and his team from the University of canaba and Melbourne University scaled an alternative method for calculating Atomic energies achieving a 3X speed up over other GPU accelerated methods and a super linear scaling on multiple gpus later we'll hear from Dr David keys at coust about their pioneering work on genomic epistasis and climate emulation but first let's turn to Dr Arvin ramanathan from argon National Laboratory to discuss their advancements in protein design one of the key tasks in protein design is to come up with novel proteins that have the same function but are different from what we have seen from over the course of 4 billion years of evolution experimental data happens to come at much slower Paces than what you would expect from a computational workflow like a simulation protein design is quite a happening area in AI right now it's undergoing this huge revolution in terms of how AI models are being deployed and developed this is one of the the first attempts at building something that's IM multimodal we actually have the descriptions that are provided in natural language and then you have the protein sequences that are represented and we basically use that to train a large language model that will enable us to interact with and get new designs and one of the key things that we also learned from this paper was the fact that yes it is possible for us to stand up this workflow not on just one platform but across several different platforms at the same time we happen to use almost all of nvidia's architecture from 00s all the way to Grace Hopper chips but one of the cool things that we observed was in terms of pre-training this model we could really achieve nearly three xof flops in mixed Precision runs on the system again this sort of runs at the scale of I think half of the system was what we actually used to achieve that sort of performance is really [Music] unbelievable one of the key benefits and motivations for accelerating workloads is to reduce energy consumption nowhere is this more understood than in supercomputing where the end of Mo's law was first predicted supercomputing centers like oish National Labs as far back as 2010 recognized that the energy for NextGen supercomputers built with CPUs will consume even more power than a major US city this truth also applies to Applications themselves even though an accelerated server May consume more power than a standard CPU system the significant reduction in time to solution results in a huge reduction in the total energy needed to compute a solution for example Texas Advanced Computing Center and Anis achieved a 110x speed up and 6X better Energy Efficiency on a 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 5

David keys of cou to tell us about their two Gordon Bell finalist submissions for genomics and climate modeling genomewide Association studies explore the great dogma of biology that genotype leads to phenotype genotype here includes not only genomic factors but also environmental factors like demographics diet smoking habits and so forth and the goal is to start with a large database of individuals we used the 305,000 person UK biobank and uh then compare their genomes and their generalized genotypes to one another and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject we actually were able by means of scaling up to go from the 3 5,000 patients for which we have real data to a synthetic database generated from 13 million patients and that number is actually enough for more than half the countries of the world to do a full genomic analysis of their populations we had very little difficulty moving the code from one to another so in particular we ran on the v100s of summit we ran on the A1 100s of Leonardo and we ran on the hopper 100s the GH configuration of Alps node for node Hopper is by far the most interesting in terms of performance and also because it offers the fp8 and we're happy to use it as close to the low Precision end as we can get away with and would encourage other domain scientists to try to take advantage of that this is a very exciting prospect uh because many future venues of smart health and smart agriculture will benefit greatly from a democratized genomewide Association studies there is a 45 institution campaign in its sixth generation of generating future climates called seip and they are starting to become handicapped by the volume of data that they produce and each of these institutions is devoting hundreds of millions of core hours to generating these future climates climate emulation is a statistical model that tries to reproduce the statistics of the chaotic simulations we actually brought the queriable distance down to about 3 and 1/2 km from maybe 100 km on earlier models we were able to obtain 8 exif flops of mixed Precision on the Alps system and that was on 2,000 of those nodes I think a digital twin is reproducing the statistics of the real world by making the full 2D surface of the Earth visible at very high resolution with data compression uh with Statistics that reproduce ensembles of pte based models we feel that we've democratized climate [Music] emulation it is incredible to see all the great work being done by researchers to harness the power of AI for science while training AI models is important the real value relies in deploying these models and using them in inference where they can generate insights and predictions in real time to make it easier for users to scale AI models in

our performance boost is the new new cou equivariance library which speeds up essential mathematical operations for molecular predictions diff do has been retrained using the plender database the largest molecular protein structur database in the world which is boosting diff's accuracy this new version is built to unlock a new scale of virtual screening and Drug Discovery and we're excited to see what our ecosystem of researchers does with it next AI has transformed the study of proteins for drug Discovery and we think AI has the potential to make the same impact in digital chemistry with an estimated 10 to the 60th possible materials in the universe and only 10 to the eth currently known there's huge potential to innovate announcing Nvidia Alchemy it's a collection of chemistry specific Nims for the discovery of new compounds scientists start by defining the properties they want like strength conductivity low toxicity or even color a generative model suggests thousands to millions of potential candidates with the desired properties then the Alchemy Nim can sort the candidate compounds for stability by solving for their lowest energy states using Nvidia warp resulting in 100 times faster design space search going from months to a day using the Alchemy workflow the best candidates are identified before moving forward to costly real world testing traditional engineering analysis workflows from physics simulation to visualization can take weeks or even months to complete most analysis of physical systems like planes and Automobiles and ships use a set of loosely coupled applications each generating information which must be interpreted by engineers at each step a real-time digital twin enables an engineer to adjust design parameters for example you could change the shape of a body panel and see how it impacts streamlines in real time announcing Omniverse blueprint for realtime digital twins the blueprint is a reference workflow that includes nvidia's acceleration libraries physics AI Frameworks and Omniverse to design simulate and visualize all in real time it can run on all Cloud platforms as well as nvidia's own djx cloud Al Cadence seens and others are exploring how to integrate the blueprint into their own services and products for design acceleration Nvidia is also collaborating with fre scale to incorporate the blueprint into their physics AI platform let's take a look at the blueprint in action everything manufactured is first simulated with Advanced physics and solvers computational fluid dynamic simulations or cfd can take hours or months limiting the number of possible design Explorations with an Nvidia Omniverse blueprint for realtime physics digital twins software makers can integrate Nvidia acceleration libraries physics ML and RTX visualization into their existing tools enabling a 1200X speed up in design iteration time here luminary Cloud builds a fully real-time virtual wind tunnel based on the blueprint first luminary uses the Nvidia modulus physics ml framework to train a simulation AI model using data generated from their Nvidia Cuda X accelerated cfd solver the model understands the complex relationship between airflow fields and varying car geometries generating results orders of magnitude times faster than with the solver alone the AI output is visualized in real time using Omniverse apis now an engineer can make geometry or scene modifications seeing the effects in real time and because of omniverses data interoperability the engineer can even bring new new geometries and the simulation will adapt instantly what took weeks or even months is now a matter of seconds software developers everywhere can now bring unprecedented speed and flexibility to the world's industrial designers and Engineers helping save massive cost and shorten the time to Market ansus is adopting nvidia's Technologies into its CA platform Anis fluent accelerated by Nvidia gpus Insight powered by Omniverse visualization and Sim AI built on Nvidia Nim microservices AI will not only transform simulation it will accelerate scientific experimentation as well an overwhelming amount of data is being generated by Advanced instruments such as radio telescopes particle accelerators x-ray light sources and fusion reactor experiments for example the square kilometer array is expected to be completed by the end of the decade the ska in Australia will produce an average of 1 terabyte a second a thousand times more than the current state-of-the-art array in particle physics the lhcb detector at CERN produces 5 terabytes of data per second following the 2030 upgrade it could reach as high as 25 terabytes per second both the instruments and the researchers time are incredibly valuable making essential to extract meaningful insights from all of this data as efficiently as possible we are working with the researchers at the SEI Institute and breakthrough listen to deploy the world's first AI search for fast radio bursts or F frbs while over 1,000 have been detected only 15 have been traced to specific galaxies we've implemented a realtime pipeline using Nvidia Hollow scan at the Allen telescope array processing data from 28 dishes at 100 gbits per second this pipeline can process 100 times more data than conventional methods used today this is the first direct feed of raw telescope data to an AI model for f frb detection Quantum Hardware offers the opportunity to revolutionize Computing in fundamental ways unfortunately today's best quantum processors can only perform hundreds of operations before their fundamental unit of computation their cubits just become overwhelmed wood noise this makes scaling Quantum Hardware into useful Computing devices impractical today we're announcing a partnership with Google to apply nvidia's state-of-the-art AI supercomputing to solve this Challenge and accelerate their Quantum Hardware development to be useful quantum computers need large numbers of cubits operating with performance far beyond today's capabilities AI supercomputing is the key to building higher quality error corrected cubits that can meet these demands Google Quantum AI is working with Nvidia to explore how to accelerate digital representations of their superconducting cubits unlike circuit simulations which focus on the highle operation of an ideal quantum computer dynamical simulations model the complex physics describing real noisy Quantum Hardware fully accounting for how the cubits inside the quantum processor interact not only with each other but also with their surrounding environment dynamical simulations are essential to understanding and reducing Cubit specific sources of noise using Nvidia hardware and software Google Quantum aai researchers can accelerate these complex simulations this enhances the ability of researchers to understand the noise in their systems explore new designs and increase Hardware performance all of which are essential for scaling Quantum [Music] processors and we're also announcing that dynamical simulation is available in Cuda QQ our open- source Quantum development platform this means that through caq simulations capture the full dynamics of every Cubit comprehensively unlike commonly performed Quantum simulations these types of comprehensive Cubit simulations that would have previously taken a week now now can run in just minutes with caq developers of all Quantum processors can perform larger simulations and explore more scalable Cubit designs together nvidia's growing network of quantum partners are driving toward the goal of achieving practical large-scale Quantum Computing as we conclude this exciting journey through nvidia's latest Innovations we invite you to come to the Nvidia Booth to see many of these Technologies firsthand interact with James our are digital human and witness the future of AI driven virtual interactions experience the world's first realtime interactive Wind Tunnel built on Nvidia Omniverse blueprints explore the power of Earth 2 NIMS in climate modeling and see how hollow scan is revolutionizing Radio astronomy you'll also hear from researchers sharing breakthroughs in fields like energy storage and seismic simulation in our theater thank you and have a great super computing 2024 [Music] Jensen this is such an honor thank you for being here I'm delighted to be here thank you in honor of your return to Stanford I decided we'd start talking about the time when you first left you joined LSI logic and that was one of the most exciting companies at the time you're building a phenomenal reputation with some of the biggest names in Tech and yet you decide to leave to become a Founder what motivated you uh uh Chris and Curtis Chris and Curtis uh uh I was an engineer at LS logic and Chris and Curtis were at Sun and I was working with with uh some of the brightest Minds in computer science at the time of all time uh including andyto shim and others uh building building workstations and Graphics workstations and so on so forth and uh Chris and Curtis uh uh said one day that they like to leave some son and they like uh me to go figure out what they're going to go leave four and and um I had a great job but they they insisted that I uh figure out you know with them how to how to build a company and so so we hung out at Denny when whenever they Dro by and and uh uh which was which is by the way my alma marter my my first company uh you know my first job before for before CEO was a was a dishwasher and so and and I did that very well and and so anyways uh we got together and and we we DEC and it was during the the microprocessor Revolution this is 1993 and and 1992 when we were getting together the PC Revolution was just getting going you you know that Windows 95 obviously which is the Revolutionary version of Windows uh didn't even come to the market yet and Pentium wasn't even announced yet and so and this is this is all before the right before the PC Revolution and it was it was pretty clear that that uh the microprocessor was going to be very important and we we thought you know why don't we build a company uh to go solve problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose Computing can't and and so that that became the company's Mission uh to go to go build a computer uh the type of computers and solve problems that normal computers can't and to this day uh we're focusing on that and if you look at all the the problems that that um and the markets that we opened up as a result uh it's you know things like uh computational drug design um uh weather simulation materials design these are all things that we're really really proud of uh robotics uh self-driving cars uh autonomous autonomous uh software we call artificial intelligence and then all you know of course uh we uh we drove the the uh U the techn techology so hard that that eventually the computational cost uh uh went to approximately zero and then enabled enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself artificial intelligence as we know it today and so so I that was that was it that was the journey yeah thank you all for [Laughter] coming well these applications are on all of our minds today but back then the CEO of LSI logic convinced his biggest investor Don Valentine to meet with you he is obviously the founder of seoa yeah now I can see a lot of Founders here edging forward in anticipation but how did you convince the most sought-after investor in Silicon Valley to invest in a team of firsttime Founders building a new product for a market that doesn't even exist I I didn't know how to write a business plan and and uh uh so I went to a went to a book bookstore and back then there were bookstores and and and um in the business book section there was this book and it was written by somebody I knew Gordon Bell and this book I should go find it again but it's a very large book and the book says how to write a business plan and and that was you know a highly specific title for a very niche market and it seems like he wrote it for like you know 14 people and I was one of them and and so I I bought the book I I should have known right away that that it was a bad idea because that you know Gordon is super super smart and super smart people have a lot to say and and they wanted you know and I I'm pretty sure Gordon wants to teach me how to write a business plan uh completely and so I I picked up this book it's like 450 pages long well I never got through it not even close I I flipped through it a few pages and I go you know what by the time I'm done reading this this thing I'll be out of business I'll be out of money and and uh Lori and I only had about 6 months uh in the bank and we had already Spencer Madison and and uh and a dog and so the five of us had to live off of you know uh whatever money we had in the bank and and so I didn't have much time uh and so instead of writing the business plan uh I just went to talk to to W Coran he turn he called me one day and said hey you know you left the company you didn't even tell me what you were doing I want you to come back and explain it to me and so I went back and I explained it to Wi and wi wi at the end of it he he said I have no idea what you said and and um that's one of the worst elevator pitches I've ever heard um and then he picked up the phone and he called Don Valentine and he he called Don and he says Don I want you to give I'm going to send a kid over I want you to give him money he's one of the best employees l logic ever ever had and um I and and so the thing I learned is is uh uh you you can make up a great interview you could even have a bad interview but you can't run away from your past and so have a good past you know try to have a good past and and and in a lot of ways I was serious when I said I was a good dishwasher I was probably Denny's best dishwasher um I I planned my work I was organized you know I was Misan plus and then I washed The Living Daylights out of the dishes and then and then you know they promoted me to bus I was certain I'm the best bus boy Denny's ever had you know I was I never left a station with empty-handed I never came back empty-handed I was very efficient and then they and so anyways eventually I became you know a CEO I'm working I'm still working on being being a good CEO but you talk about being the bad you needed to be the best among 89 other companies that were funded after you to build the same thing and then with 6 to9 months of Runway left you realized that the initial Vision was just not going to work MH how did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you well we started uh this company called for Accelerated Computing and the question is what is it for what's the killer app and and uh that was that that came our first great decision um and this is what sequa funded the first great decision was the first killer app was going to be 3D graphics and the the the technology was going to be 3D graphics and the application was going to be video games at the Time 3D Graphics was impossible to make cheap it was Million dooll image generators from Silicon graphics and the video and so it was a million dollars and and it's hard to make cheap um and the video game Market was0 billion doar so you have this incredible technology that's hard to uh commoditize and commercialize and then you have this Market that doesn't exist that was that intersection was the founding of our company and and I still remember uh when when Don at the end of my presentation uh you know Don was still kind of he he said you know know one of the things he said to me which made a lot of sense back then makes a lot of sense today he says startups don't invest in startups or startups don't partner with startups and his point is that in order for NVIDIA to succeed we needed another startup to succeed and that other startup was Electronic Arts and and then on the way out he he reminded me that electronic arts's CTO is 14 years old and had to be driven to work by his mom and he just wanted to remind me that that's who I'm relying on that that and then and uh and then after that he said if you lose my money I'll kill you and that that was that was kind of my memories of that first meeting uh but nonetheless uh we created we created something uh we went on uh the next several years to go create the market to create the gaming market for PCs and it took a long time to do so we're still doing it today uh we realize that not only do you have to create the technology and uh invent a new way of doing computer Graphics so that what was a million dollars is now you know three 400 $500 um that fits in the computer and you have to go create this new market so we have to create technology create markets the idea that a company would create technology create markets defines Nvidia today almost everything we do we create technology we create markets that's that's the reason why people say we have a you know people call it a stack an ecosystem words like that um but that's basically it at the core for 30 years what Nvidia realized we had to do is in order to uh create the conditions by which somebody could buy our products we had to go invent this new market and uh it's the reason why we were early in autonomous driving it was the reason why we're early in deep learning it was the reason why we're early and just about all these things including uh computational drug disc drug design and and Discovery um all these different areas we're trying to create the market while we're creating the technology and so that that's um uh okay and then we got we got going and and then and then um Microsoft introduced uh a standard called direct 3D and that spawned off hundreds of companies and we found ourselves a couple years later competing with just about everybody and and the thing that that we invented the company the technology we invented uh 3D graphics with the consumerized 3D with turns out to be incompatible with direct 3D so we started this company we had this 3D Graphics thing we million-dollar thing we're trying to make it consumerized and so we invented all this technology and then shortly after it became incompatible and um uh so we had to reset the company uh or go out of business but we didn't know how to we didn't know how to build it the way that Microsoft had defined it and um and I remember I remember a meeting at at you know on a weekend and the conversation was you know we now have 89 competitors uh I understand that the way we do it is not not right but we don't know how to do it the right way and and um thankfully there was another bookstore and um and the bookstore is called fries Fries electronics I don't think I don't know if it's still here um and so I had I had I had um I I I think I drove madis and my daughter on a weekend to fries and and it was sitting right there the openg manual uh which would defined uh how silicon Graphics did computer graphics and so it was it was right there it was like $68 a book and so I had a couple hundred dollar I bought three books I took it back to the office and I said guys I found it our future and I handed out I had three versions of it handed out had a big nice centerfold you know the centerfold is the opengl pipeline which is the computer Graphics Pipeline and um uh and I handed it to uh the same Geniuses that I founded the company with and we implemented the openg pipeline like nobody had ever implemented the opengl pipeline and we built something the world never seen and so uh a lot of lessons are right there that moment in time for our company uh gave us so much confidence and the reason for that is you can succeed in doing something inventing a future even if you were not informed about it at all and is kind of the my attitude about everything now you know when somebody tells me about something and I've never heard of it before or if I've heard of it never don't understand how it works at all my first thought is always you know how hard can it be and it's probably just a textbook away you know you're probably one archive paper away from figuring this out and so I spent a lot of time reading archive papers and um and it it's true it's true you can you can um now of course you can't learn how somebody else does something and do it exactly the same way and hope to have a different outcome but you could learn how something can be done and then go back to First principles and ask yourself um giving the conditions today given my motivation given the instruments the tools um given you know how things have changed how would I redo this how would I reinvent this whole thing how would I design a how would I build a car today would I build it incrementally from 1950s and 1900s how would I build a computer today how would I write software today does that make sense and so I go back to First principles all the time uh even in the company today and just reset ourselves you know because the world has changed and U the way we wrote software in the past was monolithic and it's designed for supercomputers but now it's disaggregated it's you know so on so forth and how we think about software today how we think about computers today how we think just always cause your company always cause yourself to go back to first first principles and it creates lots and lots of opportunities yeah the way you applied this technology turns to be revolutionary you get all the momentum that you need to IPO and then some more because you grow your Revenue nine times in the next four years but in the middle of all of this success you decide to Pivot a little bit the focus of innovation happening at Nvidia based on a phone call you have with this chemistry professor can you tell us about that phone call and how you connected the dots from what you heard to where you went uh remember at the core the company was uh pioneering a new way of doing Computing computer Graphics was the first application uh but we already always knew that there would be other applications and so image processing came particle physics came fluids came so on so forth all kinds of interesting things that we wanted to do uh we made the processor more programmable so that we could express more algorithms if you will and then one day we invented um uh programable shaders which made all forms of Imaging and computer Graphics programmable that was a great breakthrough so we invented Ed that on top of that we invented uh we we tried to look for ways to express um uh more comp more sophisticated algorithms uh that could be computation that could be computed on our processor which is very different than a CPU and so we we created this thing called CG this I think it was 2003 or so C for gpus it predated Cuda by about three years um the same person who wrote The textbook that saved the company Mark Hilgard wrote that textbook and um I and so CG was was super cool we wrote textbooks about it we started teaching people how to use it we developed tools and such um and then several several researchers discovered it uh many of the researchers here students here at Stanford was using it um many of the the engineers that that then became uh engineers at Nvidia were were uh playing with it uh uh a doctor a couple of doctors at at Mass General picked it up and used it for uh CT reconstruction so I flew out and saw them and said you know what are you guys doing with this thing and uh they told me about that and then and then uh a um uh a computational a Quantum chemist uh used it to um uh Express his his algorithms and so I I realized that that there's there's some evidence that people might want to use this uh and and it gave it gave us gave us you know incrementally more more confidence that that we ought to go do this that that this field this form of computing could solve problems that normal computers really can't and and um reinforced our belief and and kept us going every time you heard something new you really savored that surprise and that seems to be a theme throughout your leadership at Nvidia U it feels like you make the these bets so far in advance of Technology inflections that when the Apple finally falls from the tree you're standing right there in your black leather jacket waiting to catch it how do you find the conv always seems like a diving catch oh it does seem like a diving catch you do things based on core beliefs you know we we uh we we deeply believe that that we uh we could create a computer that solves problems Norm processing can't do that there are limits to what a CPU can do there are limits to what general purpose Computing can do and then there are interesting problems uh that we can go solve the question the question is always are those in interesting problems only or are they can they also be interesting markets because if they're not interesting markets it's not sustainable and Nvidia went through about a decade where we were investing in this future and the markets didn't exist there was only One Market at the time was computer Graphics uh for 10 15 years the markets that fuels Nvidia today just didn't exist and so so how do you continue um uh with all of the people around you you know our company and you know nvidia's management team and all of the amazing Engineers that they're creating this future with me um all of your shareholders your board of directors all your partners you're you're taking everybody with you and there's no evidence uh of a market that is really really challenging you know the fact that the technology can solve problems and the fact that you have research papers that that are used that that are made possible because of it are interesting but you're always looking for that market but nonetheless before a market exists you still need early indicators of future success you know we we have this phrase in the company is is you know there's a phrase called key performance indicators unfortunately kpis are hard to understand I find kpis hard to understand what's a good kpi you know a lot of people you know when when we look for kpis we go gross margins that's not a kpi that's a result you know you're looking for something that's an early indicators of future positive results okay and as early as possible and the reason for that is because you want early indic that early sign that you're going in the right direction and so we have this phrase is called EO ifs FS you know early indicators e FS early indicators of future success and and um and it helps people uh uh because I was using it all the time to give the company hope that hey look we solved this problem we solved that problem we solved this problem the markets didn't exist but there were important problems and that's what the company's about to solve these problems uh we want to be sustainable and therefore the markets have to exist at some point but you you want you want to decouple the result from um uh from evidence that you're doing the right thing okay and so so so that's how you that's how you kind of solve this problem of investing into something that's very very far away um and having the the conviction uh to stay on the road is to find as early as possible the indicators that you're doing the right things and so uh start with a core belief unless something you know changes your mind you continue to believe in it and um look for early indicators of future success what are some of those early indicators that have been used by product teams at Nvidia uh all kinds um uh uh I saw I saw I saw a uh a paper uh long before I saw the paper I met some people that needed my help on on um uh on this thing called Deep learning at a time I didn't even know what deep learning Le was and um and they needed us to create a domain specific language so that um all of their algorithms could be expressed easily on our on our processors and we created this thing called cdnn and it's essentially the SQL um uh SQL is in in storage Computing this is um neuron network computing and uh we created a a language if you will domain specific language for that you know kind of like the openg GL of of uh deep learning and so we we uh they needed us to do that so that they they could express their mathematics and uh they didn't understand Cuda but they understood their deep learning and so we created this thing in the middle for them uh and the reason why we did it was because uh even though there were zero I mean this you know these researchers had no money uh and and this is kind of one of the the great skills of our company that that you're willing to do something even though the financial returns are complet completely non-existent or maybe very very far out even if you believed in it uh we we ask ourselves you know is this worthy work to do um does this Advance a field of science somewhere that matters notice this is something that I I've been talking about you know since the very beginning of time uh we ex we we find inspiration uh not from the size of a market from but from the importance of the work uh because the importance of the work is the early indicators of a future Market and nobody has to write a nobody has to do a a um a business case on it nobody has to show me a a pnl uh nobody has to show me a financial forecast the only question is is this important work and if we didn't do it uh would it happen without us now if we didn't do something and something could happen without us it gives me tremendous Joy actually and the reason for that is could you imagine the world got better you didn't have to lift a finger that's the definition of you know of of uh ultimate laziness and and and in a lot of ways in a lot of ways you want that habit and the reason for that is this uh you want the company to be lazy about doing things that other people always do can do if somebody else can do it let them do it we should go select the things that if we didn't do it the world the world would fall apart you have to convince yourself of that that if I don't do this it won't get done that is Inc and and if that work is hard and that work is impactful and important then it gives you a sense of purpose does that make sense and so our company has been selecting these projects deep learning was just one of them and the first indicator of of the success of that was this you know fuzzy cat that that Andrew an came up with and um then Alex kvki uh detected cats um you know not all the time but you know successfully enough that it was you know this might take us somewhere and then we reasoned about the structure of deep learning and you know we're computer scientists and we understand how things work and and so we we uh we convinced ourselves this could change everything and and um and anyhow that but that's an that's an example so these selections that you've made they've paid huge dividends both literally and figuratively um but you've had to steer the company through some very challenging times like when it lost 80% of its market cap amid the financial crisis cuz what Wall Street didn't believe in your bet on ML um in times like these how do you steer the company and keep the employees motivated at the task at hand uh it's this is the my reaction during that time is the same reaction I had about this week uh earlier today you asked me about this week my pulse was exactly the same this week is no different than last week or the week before that um and so the opposite of that you know when you drop it 80% um it don't get me wrong when when your share price drops 80% it's a little embarrassing okay and and um you just want to you just want to wear a t-shirt that says wasn't my fault um but even more than that you just you just don't want to you you don't want to get out of your bed you don't want to leave the house um all of that is true all of that is true um but then you go back to go back to just doing your job I woke up at the same time I prioritize my day in the same way uh I go back to what do I believe uh you got to gut check always gut check back to the court you know what do you believe uh what are the most important things uh and uh just check them off you know sometimes sometimes it's helpful to you know family loves me okay check um you know double you know right and so you just got to check it off and and you go back to your core um and then go back to work and and then every conversations go back to the core uh keep the company focused back on the core do you believe in it did something change the stock price changed but did something else change the physics change the gravity change did did all of the things that that that we assumed uh that we believed that led to our decision did any of those things change because if those things change you got to change everything but if none of those things change you change nothing you keep on going yeah yeah that's how you do it in speaking with your employees they say that you try to avoid the public in speaking with your employees they've said that your leadership including the employees I'm just kidding no le lead leaders have to be seen unfortunately that's the hard that's the hard part you know I I I was I was I was at I was I was an electrical engineering student and I was quite Young when I went to school um when I went to went to College I was I was still 16 years old and so I was I was young when I did everything and and so I was a bit of an introvert kind of you know I'm shy I don't enjoy public speaking I'm delighted to be here I'm not suggesting um but but it's it's not something that I do naturally and and um I and so so when when things are challenging um uh it's not easy to be in front of precisely the people that you care most about you know and the reason for that is because could you imagine a company meeting we just our stock prices dropped by 80% and the most important thing I have to do as the CEO is this to come and face you explain it and partly you're not sure why partly you're not sure how long uh how bad yeah you just don't know these things and and but you still got to explain it face face all these people and you know what they're thinking you know you you know some of them are probably thinking we're doomed uh some people are probably thinking you're an idiot and some people are probably thinking you know something else and so I um there are a lot of things that people are thinking and you know that they're thinking those things but you still have to get in front of them and and and deal you know do the hard work they may be thinking of those things but yet not a single person of your leadership team left during times like this and in fact unemployable that's what I keep reminding them I'm just kidding I'm surrounded by Geniuses I'm surrounded by Geniuses yeah other Geniuses un un unbelievable uh Nvidia is well known to have singularly the best management team on the planet this is the deepest technology management team the world's ever seen I'm surrounded by a whole bunch of them and they're just genius business teams marketing teams sales teams just incredible and engineering teams my research teams unbelievable yeah your employees say that your leadership style is very engaged you have 50 direct reports you encourage people across all parts of the organization to send you the top five things on their mind and you constantly remind people that no task is beneath you can you tell us why you've purposefully designed such a flat organization and how should we be thinking about our organizations that we designed in the future uh no task is is to me no task is beneath me because remember I used to be a dishwasher and I and I mean that I used to clean toilets I mean you know I cleaned a lot of toilets I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined and and some of them just can't [Laughter] unsee I don't know I I don't know what to tell you you know that's life and and so so uh uh you can't show me and you can't show me a task that is that's beneath me um now I'm not doing it I'm not doing it uh only because because of uh you know whether it's beneath me or not beneath me U if you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you and in my in my review of IT share with you how I reason through it uh I've made a contribution to you I've made I've made it possible for you to see how I reason through something and and by reasoning as you know how someone reasons through something empowers you you go oh my gosh that's how you reason through something like this it's not as complicated as it seems this is how you reason through something that's super ambiguous this is how you reason through something that's incalculable this is how you reason through something that you know seems to be very scary this is how you seem do you understand and so I show people how to reason through things all the time strategy things you know how to forecast something how to break a problem down uh and you're just you're empowering people all over the place and so that's how I see it if you send me something you want me to help review it uh I'll do my best and I'll show you how I would do it um I in the process of doing that of course I learned a lot from you is that right you gave me a seat of a lot of information I learned a lot and so I I feel rewarded by the process um it does take a lot of energy sometimes because you know you got in order to add value to somebody and they're incredibly smart as a starting point and I'm surrounded by incredibly smart people you have to at least get to their plane you know you have to get into their head space and that's really hard that's really hard um and that takes just an enormous amount of emotional and intellectual energy and so I feel exhausted after after I I work on things like that um I'm surrounded by by a lot of great people a CEO should have the most direct report rep s um uh by definition because the people that reports to the CEO requires the least amount of management it makes no sense to me that CEOs have so few people reporting to them except for one fact that I know to be true the the knowledge the information of a CEO is supposedly so so valuable so secretive you can only share with two other people or three and their information is so invaluable so incredibly secretive that they can only share with a couple more well um I don't believe in in in a culture an environment where the information that you possess is the reason why you have power I would like us all to to to contribute to the company and our position in the company should have something to do with our ability to reason through complicated things lead other people to um achieve greatness um Inspire Empower other people um support other people those are the reasons why the the management team exists in service of all of the other people that work in the company to create the conditions by which all of the all of these amazing people who volunteer to come work for you instead of all the other amazing high-tech companies around the world they elected they volunteer to work for you and so you should create the conditions by which they could do their life's work which is Mission you know you probably heard it i' I've said that you know pretty clearly and I and I believe that what my job is is very simply to create the conditions by which you could do your life's work and so how do I do that what does that condition look like well that condition should um result in great deal of empowerment you should you can only be empowered if you understand the circumstance isn't it right you have to understand the cont you have to understand the context of the situation you're in in order for you to come up with great ideas and so I have to create a circumstance where you understand the context which means you have to be informed and the best way to be informed is for there to be as little layers of information mutilation right between us and so that's the reason why it's very often that I'm reasoning through things like in an audience like this I say first of all this is the beginning facts these are the data that we have um this is how I would reason through it these are some of the assumptions these are some of the unknowns these are some of the knowns and so you reason through it and now you've created an organization that's highly empowered nvidia's 30,000 people we're the smallest large company in the world we're tiny little company but every employee is so empowered and they're making smart decisions on my behalf every single day and the reason for that is because you know they understand that they understand my condition they understand my condition I'm very transparent with people um and uh and I believe that that I can trust you with the information often times the information is hard to hear and uh the the situations are complicated uh but I trust that you can handle it you're you know a lot of people hear me say you know these you're adults here you can handle this sometimes they're not really adults they just graduated I'm just kidding I know that when I first graduated was barely an adult and um I but I was I was fortunate that I was trusted with with uh with uh important information so I want to do that I want to create the conditions for people to do that I do want to now address the topic that is on everybody's mind AI last week you said that generative Ai and accelerated Computing have hit the Tipping Point so as this technology becomes more mainstream what are the applications that you personally are most excited about well you have to go back to First principles and ask yourself what is generative AI what happened um what happened was we have a we now have the ability to have software that can understand something they they can understand why you know what is first of all we digitized everything that was you know like for example Gene sequencing you digitized genes but what does it mean that sequence of genes what does it mean we've digitized amino acids um but what does it mean uh and so we now have the ability we dig digitize words we digitize sounds uh we digitize images and videos we digitize a lot of things but what does it mean we now have the ability through um a lot of study a lot of Da data and from their patterns and relationships we We Now understand what they mean not only do we understand what they mean we we can translate between them because we learned about the meaning of these things in the same world we didn't learn about them separately so we we learned about speech and and words and and paragraphs and vocabulary in the same context and so we found correlations between them and they're all you know registered if you will registered to each other and so now we uh not only do we understand uh the modality the meaning of each modality we can understand how to translate between them and so uh for obvious things you could caption video to text that's captioning uh text to uh images M Journey uh text to text chat GPT I amazing things and so so we now we now know that uh we understand meaning and we can translate uh the translation of something is generation of information and and um uh and all of a sudden you you have to take your you take a step back and ask yourself um uh what is the implication in every single layer of everything that we do and so I'm exercising in front of you I'm reasoning in front of you uh the same thing I did a quarter uh 15 years ago when I first saw um uh alexnet some 13 14 years ago I guess um I how I reasoned through it uh what did I see how interesting what can it do very cool but then most importantly what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean to every single layer of computing because you know we're in the world of computing and so what it means is that that the way that we um process information fundamentally will be different in the future that's what Nvidia builds you know chips and system the way we write software will be fundamentally different in the future the type of software we'll be able to write write in the future will be different new applications and then ALS also the processing of those applications will be different what was historically a retrieval based model where uh in uh information was pre pre-recorded if you will almost you know we wrote the text pre-recorded and we retrieved it based on uh some recommender system algorithm in the future uh some seed of information will be will be uh the starting point we call them prompts you as you guys know and then we generate the rest of it and so the future of computing will be highly generated well let me give you an example of what's happening for example uh we're having a conversation right now very little of the information I'm trans I'm conveying to you is Retreat most of it is generated it's called intelligence and so in the future we're going to have a lot more generative our computers will will perform in that way it's going to be highly generative instead of Highly retrieval based you go back and you got to ask yourself you know now for for you know entrepreneurs you got to ask yourself uh what industries will be disrupted therefore will we think about networking the same way will we think about storage the same way will we think about would we be as abusive of internet traffic as we are today probably not notice we're having a conversation right now and and I to get in my car every every question so we don't have to be as abusive of of transformation information transporting as we used to um uh what's going to be more what's going to be less uh what kind of applications you know etc etc so you can go through the entire industrial spread and ask yourself what's going to get disrupted what's going to get be different what's going to get NED you know so on so forth and and that reasoning starts from what is happening what is generative AI Foundation Al what is happening go back to First principles with all things there was something I was going to tell you about organization you asked the question and I forgot to answer it the way you create an organization by the way someday um don't worry about how other companies or charts look you start from first principles remember what an organization is designed to do the organizations of the past where there's a king you know CE and then then you have all all these you know the Royal subjects you know the Royal Court and then eaff and then you keep working your way down eventually they're employees well the reason why it was designed that way is because they they wanted the employees to have as low information as possible because their fundamental purpose of the soldiers is to die in the field of battle to die without asking questions you guys know this I don't I only have 30,000 employees I would like them none of them to die I would like them to question everything does that make sense and so the way you organize in the past and the way you organize today is very different to Second the question is what is nid what does Nvidia build an organization is designed so that we could build what it whatever it is we build better and so if we all build different things why why are we organized the same way why would why would this organizational Machinery be exactly the same irrespective of what you build it doesn't make make any sense you build computers you organize this way you build healthare Services you build exactly the same way it makes no sense whatsoever and so you had to go back to First principles just ask yourself what kind of Machinery what what is the input what is the output what are the properties of this environment you know what what is the what is the what is the forest that this animal has to live in what is this characteristics is it stable most of the time you're trying to squeeze out the last drop of water or is it changing all the time being attacked by everybody and so you got to understand you know you're the CEO your job is to architect this company that's my first job to create the conditions by which you can do your life's work and the architecture has to be right and so you have to go back to First principles and think about those things and I was fortunate that that when I was 29 years old you know I had the benefit of of of taking a step back and asking myself you know how would I build this company for the future and what would it look like and you know what's the operating system which is called culture what do we what kind of behavior do we en encourage enhance and what what do we discourage and not enhance you know so on so forth and anyways I want to save time for audience questions but um this year's theme for view from the top is redefining tomorrow and one question we've asked all of our guests is Jensen as the co-founder and CEO of Nvidia if you were to close your eyes and magically change one thing about tomorrow what would it be were we supposed to think about this in advance I I'm going to give you a horrible answer um I I don't know that it's one thing look there are a lot of things we don't control you know there are a lot of things we don't control um your job is to make a unique contribution live a life of purpose to do something that nobody else in the world would do or can do to make a unique contribution so that in the event that after you done um everybody says you know the world was better because you were here and so I think that that to me um I live I live my life kind of like this I go forward in time and I Look Backwards so you asked me a question that's exactly from a from a computer vision pose perspective exactly the opposite of how I think I never look forward from where I am I go forward in time and look backwards and the reason for that is it's easier I would look backwards and kind of read my history we did this and we did that way and we broke that prom down does that make sense and so it's a little bit like um how you guys solve problems you figure figure out what is the end result that you're looking for and you work backwards to achieve it and so I imagine Nvidia uh making a unique contribution to advancing the the future of of uh of computing which is the single most important instrument of all Humanity now it's not about our self self-importance but this is just what we're good at and it's incredibly hard to do and we believe we can make an absolute unique contribution it's taken US 31 years to be here and we're still just beginning our journey and so this is insanely hard to do and uh uh When I Look Backwards I believe that we made I believe that that we're going to be remembered as a company that kind of changed everything not because we went out and changed everything through all the things that we said but because we did this one thing that was insanely hard to do that we're incredibly good at doing that we loved doing we did for a long time I'm part of the GSP lead I graduated in 2023 so my question is how do you see see your company in the next decade as what challenges do you see your company would face and how you are positioned for that first of all can I just tell you what was going on through my head as you say what challenges the list that flew by my head was so so large uh that that I was trying to figure out what to select um now the honest truth is is that when you ask that question most of the challenges that showed up for me were technical challenges and the reason for that is because that was my morning if you were to you know chosen yesterday um it might have been Market creation challenges there are some markets that I gosh I just desperately would love to create I just can't we just do it already you know but we can't do it alone Nvidia is a technology platform company we're here in service of a whole bunch of other the companies so that they could realize if you will our hopes and dreams through them and and so some of the things that I would love I would love for the world of biology to to be at a point where it's kind of like the world of Chip design 40 years ago computer AED and design um Eda that entire industry really made possible for us today and I believe we're going to make possible for them tomorrow computer AED drug design because we're able to now represent genes and proteins and even cells now very very close to be able to represent and understand the meaning of a cell a combination of a whole bunch of genes um what is a cell mean it's kind of like what does that paragraph mean well if we could understand a a cell like we can understand a paragraph imagine what we could do and so uh so so I'm I'm anxious for that to happen you know I'm kind of excited about that uh there's some that I'm just excited about that I know we around the corner on for example uh humanoid robotics very very close around the corner and the reason for that is because if you can tokenize and understand speech why can't you tokenize and understand uh manipulation and so so these kind of computer science techniques you once you figure something out you ask yourself well if got do that why can't I do that and so I'm excited about those kind of things um and so that challenge is kind of a happy challenge uh some of the some of the other challenges some of the other challenges of course are industrial and geopolitical and they're social and and but you've heard all that stuff before these are all true you know the social issues in in the world uh the geopolitical issues in the world uh why can't we just get along uh things in the world why do I have to say those kind of things in the world um why do we have to say those things and then amplify them in the world uh why do we have to judge people so much in the world uh you you know all those things you guys all know that I don't have to say those things over again my name is Jose I'm a class of the 2023 uh from the GSB my question is uh are you worried at all about the pace at which we're developing AI um and do you believe that any sort of Regulation might be needed thank you uh yeah that's uh the answer is yes and no um we need uh you you know that the the the greatest breakthrough in uh modern AI of course deep learning and it enabled great progress but another incredible breakthrough is something that that humans know and we practice all the time uh and we just invented it for uh for language models called uh grounding reinforcement learning human feedback um I provide reinforcement learning human feedback every day that's my job um and their for their parents in the room uh you're providing reinforcement learning human feedback all the time okay now we just figured out how to do that um at a system systematic level for artificial intelligence there are a whole bunch of other technology necessary to uh guardrail uh fine-tune ground for example how do I generate um how do I generate uh uh uh tokens that obey the laws of physics you know right now things are floating in space and doing things and they don't they don't obey the laws of physics um how do that requires technology Guard railing requires technology fine-tuning requires technology alignment requires technology safety requires technology the reason why planes are so safe is because you know all of the autopilot systems are are surrounded by diversity and redundancy and all kinds of different functional safety and active safety systems that were invented I need all of that to be invented much much faster uh you also know that that the border between security and artificial intelligence cyber security and artificial intelligence is going to become blurry and blurry we need technology to advance very very quickly in the area of cyber security in in order to protect us from artificial intelligence and so so in a lot of ways we need technology to go faster a lot faster okay uh regulation there's two types of Regulation uh there's social regulation I don't know what to do about that but there's product and services regulation know exactly what to do about that okay so um the fa the FAA the FDA the uh Nitsa you name it all the the fs and all the NS and all the you know fcc's the they all have regulations for products and services that are have particular use cases uh um uh bar exams and doctors and you know so on so forth um you all have uh qual qualification exams you all have standards that you have to reach you all have to uh continuously be certified uh accountants and so on so forth whether it's a product or a service there are lots and lots of regulations please do not add a super regulation that cuts across of it the regulator who is regulating accounting should not be the regulator that regulates a doctor you know I love accountants um but I I just you know if I ever need an open heart surgery the fact that they can close books is interesting but not sufficient and so and so I I would like I would like um all of those all of those fields that already have products and services um to also enhance their regulation in context of in the context of AI okay but I left out this one very big one which is this the social implication of AI and how do you how do you deal with that I don't have great answers for that um but you know enough people are talking about it but it's important to subdivide all of this into chunks does that make sense so that we don't we don't become super hyperfocused on this one thing at the expense of a whole bunch of routine things that we could have done and as a result people are getting killed by cars and planes and you know it doesn't make any sense we should make sure that we we do the right things there okay very practical things may I take one more question well we have some rapid fire questions for you as view from the tradition okay I was trying to avoid that okay all right far away far away well your first job was at Denny's they now have a booth dedicated to you what was your fondest memory of working my second job was AMD by the way is there Booth dedicated to me there I'm just kidding um I'm I love my job there I did I love there it's a great company yeah yeah um if there were a worldwide shortage of black leather jackets what would we be see you wearing oh no I've I've got a large reservoir of black jackets I'm the I'll be the only person who is who is not concerned um you spoke a lot about textbooks if you had to write one what would it be called I wouldn't write one you're asking me a hypothetical question that has no possibility of of of uh that's fair and finally if you could share one parting piece of advice to broadcast across Stanford what would it be uh it's not a word but but um I you know have a core belief um gut check it every day I pursue it with all your might pursue it for a very long time surround yourself with people you love and take them on that right so that's the story of Nvidia Jensen this last hour has been a treat thank you for spending thank you very much [Music] than I am I am a Visionary Illuminating galaxies to witness the birth of stars and sharpening our understanding of extreme weather events I am a helper guiding the blind through a crowded world I was thinking about running to the store and giving voice to those who cannot speak to not make me laugh I am a Transformer harnessing gravity to store Renewable Power and Paving the way towards unlimited clean energy for us all I am a trainer teaching robots to assist to watch out for danger and help save lives I am a Healer providing a new generation of cures and new levels of patient care doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications definitely these antibiotics don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them I am a navigator generating virtual scenarios to let us safely explore the real world and understand every decision I even helped write the script breathe life into the words I am AI brought to life by Nvidia deep learning and Brilliant Minds everywhere please welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Wong welcome to GTC I hope you realize this is not a concert you have arrived at a developers conference there will be a lot of science described algorithms computer architecture mathematics I sensed a very heavy weight in the room all of a sudden almost like you were in the wrong place no no conference in the world is there a great assembly of researchers from such diverse fields of science from climatech to radio Sciences trying to figure out how to use AI to robotically control MOS for Next Generation 6G radios robotic self-driving car s even artificial intelligence even artificial intelligence everybody's first I noticed a sense of relief there all of all of a sudden also this conference is represented by some amazing companies this list this is not the attendees these are the presentors and what's amazing is this if you take away all of my friends close friends Michael Dell is sitting right there in the IT industry all of the friends I grew up with in the industry if you take away that list this is what's amazing these are the presenters of the non it Industries using accelerated Computing to solve problems that normal computers can't it's represented in life sciences healthc Care genomics Transportation of course retail Logistics manufacturing industrial the gamut of Industries represented is truly amazing and you're not here to attend only you're here to present to talk about your research $100 trillion dollar of the world's Industries is represented in this room today this is absolutely amazing there is absolutely something happening there is something going on the industry is being transformed not just ours because the computer industry the computer is the single most important instrument of society today fundamental transformations in Computing affects every industry but how did we start how did we get here I made a little cartoon for you literally I drew this in one page this is nvidia's Journey started in 1993 this might be the rest of the talk 1993 this is our journey we were founded in 1993 there are several important events that happen along the way I'll just highlight a few in 2006 Cuda which has turned out to have been a revolutionary Computing model we thought it was revolutionary then it was going to be an overnight success and almost 20 years later it happened we saw it coming two decades later in 2012 alexnet Ai and Cuda made first Contact in 2016 recognizing the importance of this Computing model we invented a brand new type of computer we called the dgx one 170 Tera flops in this supercomputer eight gpus connected together for the very first time I hand delivered the very first dgx-1 to a startup located in San Francisco called open AI dgx-1 was the world's first AI supercomputer remember 170 Tera flops 2017 the Transformer arrived 2022 chat GPT capture the world's imag imaginations have people realize the importance and the capabilities of artificial intelligence and 2023 generative AI emerged and a new industry begins why why is a new industry because the software never existed before we are now producing software using computers to write software producing software that never existed before it is a brand new category it took share from nothing it's a brand new category and the way you produce the software is unlike anything we've ever done before in data centers generating tokens producing floating Point numbers at very large scale as if in the beginning of this last Industrial Revolution when people realized that you would set up factories apply energy to it and this invisible valuable thing called electricity came out AC generators and 100 years later 200 years later we are now creating new types of electrons tokens using infrastructure we call factories AI factories to generate this new incredibly valuable thing called artificial intelligence a new industry has emerged well well we're going to talk about many things about this new industry we're going to talk about how we're going to do Computing next we're going to talk about the type of software that you build because of this new industry the new software how you would think about this new software what about applications in this new industry and then maybe what's next and how can we start preparing today for what is about to come next well but before I start I want to show you the soul of Nvidia the soul of our company at the intersection of computer Graphics physics and artificial intelligence all intersecting inside a computer in Omniverse in a virtual world simulation everything we're going to show you today literally everything we're going to show you today is a simulation not animation it's only beautiful because it's physics the world is beautiful it's only amazing because it's being animated with robotics it's being animated with artificial intelligence what you're about to see all day it's completely generated completely simulated and Omniverse and all of it what you're about to enjoy is the world's first concert where everything is homemade everything is homemade you're about to watch some home videos so sit back and enjoy yourself m what a God I love it Nvidia accelerated Computing has reached the Tipping Point general purpose Computing has run out of steam we need another way of doing Computing so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing so that we can continue to consume more and more Computing while being sustainable accelerated Computing is a dramatic speed up over general purpose Computing and in every single industry we engage and I'll show you many the impact is dramatic but in no industry is a more important than our own the industry of using simulation tools to create products in this industry it is not about driving down the cost of computing it's about driving up the scale of computing we would like to be able to sim at the entire product that we do completely in full Fidelity completely digitally in essentially what we call digital twins we would like to design it build it simulate it operate it completely digitally in order to do that we need to accelerate an entire industry and today I would like to announce that we have some Partners who are joining us in this journey to accelerate their entire ecosystem so that we can bring the world into accelerated Computing but there's a bonus when you become accelerated your infrastructure is cou to gpus and when that happens it's exactly the same infrastructure for generative Ai and so I'm just delighted to announce several very important Partnerships there are some of the most important companies in the world and Anis does engineering simulation for what the world makes we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the ancis ecosystem to connect anus to the Omniverse digital twin incredible the thing that's really great is that the install base of media GPU accelerated systems are all over the world in every cloud in every system all over Enterprises and so the app the applications they accelerate will have a giant installed base to go serve end users will have amazing applications and of course system makers and csps will have great customer demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally first software partner they were there in very first day of our company synopsis revolutionized the chip industry with high level design we are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're accelerating computational lithography one of the most important applications that nobody's ever known about in order to make chips we have to push lithography to limit Nvidia has created a library domain specific library that accelerates computational lithography incredibly once we can accelerate and software Define all of tsmc who is announcing today that they're going to go into production with Nvidia kitho once this software defined and accelerated the next step is to apply generative AI to the future of semiconductor manufacturing push in Geometry even further Cadence builds the world's essential Eda and SDA tools we also use Cadence between these three companies ansis synopsis and Cadence we basically build Nvidia together we are cud accelerating Cadence they're also building a supercomputer out of Nvidia gpus so that their customers could do fluid Dynamic simulation at a 100 a thousand times scale basically a wind tunnel in real time Cadence Millennium a supercomputer with Nvidia gpus inside a software company building supercomputers I love seeing that building Cadence co-pilots together imagine a day when Cadence could synopsis ansis tool providers would offer you AI co-pilots so that we have thousands and thousands of co-pilot assistants helping us design chips Design Systems and we're also going to connect Cadence digital twin platform to Omniverse as you could see the trend here we're accelerating the world's CAE Eda and SDA so that we could create our future in digital Twins and we're going to connect them all to Omniverse the fundamental operating system for future digital twins one of the industries that benefited tremendously from scale and you know you all know this one very well large language model basically after the Transformer was invented we were able to scale large language models at incredible rates effectively doubling every six months now how is it possible that by doubling every six months that we have grown the industry we have grown the computational requirements so far and the reason for that is quite simply this if you double the size of the model you double the size of your brain you need twice as much information to go fill it and so every time you double your parameter count you also have to appropriately increase your training token count the combination of those two numbers becomes the computation scale you have to support the latest the state-of-the-art open AI model is approximately 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 8 trillion parameters 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 8 trillion parameters required several trillion tokens to go train so so a few trillion parameters on the order of a few trillion tokens on the order of when you multiply the two of them together approximately 30 40 50 billion quadrillion floating Point operations per second now we just have to do some Co math right now just hang hang with me so you have 30 billion quadrillion a quadrillion is like a paa and so if you had a PA flop GPU you would need 30 billion seconds to go compute to go train that model 30 billion seconds is approximately 1,000 years well 1,000 years it's worth it like to do it sooner but it's worth it which is usually my answer when most people tell me hey how long how long's it going to take to do something 20 years how it it's worth it but can we do it next week and so 1,000 years 1,000 years so what we need what we need are bigger gpus we need much much bigger gpus we recognized this early on and we realized that the answer is to put a whole bunch of gpus together and of course innovate a whole bunch of things along the way like inventing 10 censor cores advancing MV links so that we could create essentially virtually Giant gpus and connecting them all together with amazing networks from a company called melanox infiniband so that we could create these giant systems and so djx1 was our first version but it wasn't the last we built we built supercomputers all the way all along the way in 2021 we had Seline 4500 gpus or so and then in 2023 we built one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world it's just come online EOS and as we're building these things we're trying to help the world build these things and in order to help the world build these things we got to build them first we build the chips the systems the networking all of the software necessary to do this you should see these systems imagine writing a piece of software that runs across the entire system Distributing the computation across thousands of gpus but inside are thousands of smaller gpus millions of gpus to distribute work across all of that and to balance the workload so that you can get the most Energy Efficiency the best computation time keep your cost down and so those those fundamental Innovations is what got us here and here we are as we see the miracle of chat GPT emerg in front of us we also realize we have a long ways to go we need even larger models we're going to train it with multimodality data not just text on the internet but we're going to we're going to train it on texts and images and graphs and charts and just as we learn watching TV and so there's going to be a whole bunch of watching video so that these Mo models can be grounded in physics understands that an arm doesn't go through a wall and so these models would have common sense by watching a lot of the world's video combined with a lot of the world's languages it'll use things like synthetic data generation just as you and I do when we try to learn we might use our imagination to simulate how it's going to end up just as I did when I Was preparing for this keynote I was simulating it all along the way I hope it's going to turn out as well as I had it in my head as I was simulating how this keynote was going to turn out somebody did say that another performer did her performance completely on a treadmill so that she could be in shape to deliver it with full energy I I didn't do that if I get a l wind at about 10 minutes into this you know what happened and so so where were we we're sitting here using synthetic data generation we're going to use reinforcement learning we're going to practice it in our mind we're going to have ai working with AI training each other just like student teacher Debaters all of that is going to increase the size of our model it's going to increase the amount of the amount of data that we have and we're going to have to build even bigger gpus Hopper is fantastic but we need bigger gpus and so ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to a very very big GPU named after David Blackwell math ician game theorists probability we thought it was a perfect per per perfect name black wealth ladies and gentlemen enjoy this the com Blackwell is not a chip Blackwell is the name of a platform uh people think we make gpus and and we do but gpus don't look the way they used to here here's the here's the here's the the if you will the heart of the blackw system and this inside the company is not called Blackwell it's just the number and um uh this this is Blackwell sitting next to oh this is the most advanced GPU in the world in production today this is Hopper this is Hopper Hopper changed the world this is Blackwell it's okay Hopper you're you're very good good good boy well good girl 208 billion transistors and so so you could see you I can see that there's a small line between two dyes this is the first time two dieses have abutted like this together in such a way that the two chip the two dieses think it's one chip there's 10 terabytes of data between it 10 terabytes per second so that these two these two sides of the Blackwell Chip have no clue which side they're on there's no memory locality issues no cach issues it's just one giant chip and so uh when we were told that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond the limits of physics uh the engineer said so what and so this is what what happened and so this is the Blackwell chip and it goes into two types of systems the first one is form fit function compatible to Hopper and so you slide all Hopper and you push in Blackwell that's the reason why one of the challenges of ramping is going to be so efficient there are installations of Hoppers all over the world and they could be they could be you know the same infrastructure same design the power the electricity The Thermals the software identical push it right back and so this is a hopper version for the current hgx configuration and this is what the other the second Hopper looks like this now this is a prototype board and um Janine could I just borrow ladies and gentlemen Jan Paul and so this this is the this is a fully functioning board and I just be careful here this right here is I don't know10 billion the second one's five it gets cheaper after that so any customers in the audience it's okay all right but this is this one's quite expensive this is to bring up board and um and the the way it's going to go to production is like this one here okay and so you're going to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected to a Grace CPU the grace CPU has a super fast chipto chip link what's amazing is this computer is the first of its kind where this much computation first of all fits into this small of a place second it's memory coherent they feel like they're just one big happy family working on one application together and so everything is coherent within it um the just the amount of you know you saw the numbers there's a lot of terabytes this and terabytes that's um but this is this is a miracle this is a this let's see what are some of the things on here uh there's um uh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on on uh your which one is mine and your left one of them it doesn't matter uh one of them one of them is a CPU chipto chip link is my left or your depending on which side I was just I was trying to sort that out and I just kind of doesn't matter hopefully it comes plugged in so okay so this is the grace Blackwell system but there's more so it turns out it turns out all of the specs is fantastic but we need a whole lot of new features uh in order to push the limits Beyond if you will the limits of physics we would like to always get a lot more X factors and so one of the things that we did was We Invented another Transformer engine another Transformer engine the second generation it has the ability to dynamically and automatically rescale and recas numerical formats to a lower Precision whenever it can remember artificial intelligence is about probability and so you kind of have you know 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 7 approximately 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 7 time approximately 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 4 to be approximately something else does that make sense and so so the the ability for the mathematics to retain the Precision and the range necessary in that particular stage of the pipeline super important and so this is it's not just about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU it's not quite the world's not quite that simple you've got to figure out when you can use that across a computation that is thousands of gpus it's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you want to make sure that the the uh uh the training job is going going to converge and so this new Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV link it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very importantly it has computation in the network and the reason for that is because when you have so many different gpus working together we have to share our information with each other we have to synchronize and update each other and every so often we have to reduce the partial products and then rebroadcast out the partial products the sum of the partial products back to everybody else and so there's a lot of what is called all reduce and all to all and all gather it's all part of this area of synchronization and collectives so that we can have gpus working with each other having extraordinarily fast links and being able to do mathematics right in the network allows us to essentially amplify even further so even though it's 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 8 terabytes per second it's effectively higher than that and so it's many times that of Hopper the likel Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on in is approximately zero and the reason for that is because there's so many components working at the same time the statistic the probability of them working continuously is very low and so we need to make sure that whenever there is a well we checkpoint and restart as often as we can but if we have the ability to detect a weak chip or a weak note early we could retire it and maybe swap in another processor that ability to keep the utilization of the supercomputer High especially when you just spent $2 billion building it is super important and so we put in a Ras engine a reliability engine that does 100% self test in system test of every single gate every single bit of memory on the Blackwell chip and all the memory that's connected to it it's almost as if we shipped with every single chip its own Advanced tester that we CH test our chips with this is the first time we're doing this super excited about it secure AI only this conference do they clap for Ras the the uh secure AI uh obviously you've just spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating a very important Ai and the the code the intelligence of that AI is encoded in the parameters you want to make sure that on the one hand you don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get contaminated and so we now have the ability to encrypt data of course at rest but also in transit and while it's being computed it's all encrypted and so we now have the ability to encrypt and transmission and when we're Computing it it is in a trusted trusted environment trusted uh engine environment and the last thing is decompression moving data in and out of these nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really essential and so we've put in a high linee speed compression engine and effectively moves data 20 times times faster in and out of these computers these computers are are so powerful and there's such a large investment the last thing we want to do is have them be idle and so all of these capabilities are intended to keep Blackwell fed and as busy as possible overall compared to Hopper it is two and a half times two and a half times the fp8 performance for training per chip it is ALS it also has this new format called fp6 so that even though the computation speed is the same the bandwidth that's Amplified because of the memory the amount of parameters you can store in the memory is now Amplified fp4 effectively doubles the throughput this is vitally important for inference one of the things that that um is becoming very clear is that whenever you use a computer with AI on the other side when you're chatting with the chatbot when you're asking it to uh review or make an image remember in the back is a GPU generating tokens some people call it inference but it's more appropriately generation the way that Computing is done in the past was retrieval you would grab your phone you would touch something um some signals go off basically an email goes off to some storage somewhere there's pre-recorded content somebody wrote a story or somebody made an image or somebody recorded a video that record pre-recorded content is then streamed back to the phone and recomposed in a way based on a recommender system to present the information to you you know that in the future the vast majority of that content will not be retrieved and the reason for that is because that was pre-recorded by somebody who doesn't understand the context which is the reason why we have to retrieve so much content if you can be working with an AI that understands the context who you are for what reason you're fetching this information and produces the information for you just the way you like it the amount of energy we save the amount of networking bandwidth we save the amount of waste of time we save will be tremendous the future is generative which is the reason why we call it generative AI which is the reason why this is a brand new industry the way we compute is fundamentally different we created a processor for the generative AI era and one of the most important parts of it is content token generation we call it this format is fp4 well that's a lot of computation 5x the Gen token generation 5x the inference capability of Hopper seems like enough but why stop there the answer is it's not enough and I'm going to show you why I'm going to show you why and so we would like to have a bigger GPU even bigger than this one and so we decided to scale it and notice but first let me just tell you how we've scaled over the course of the last eight years we've increased computation by 1,000 times8 years 1,000 times remember back in the good old days of Moore's Law it was 2x well 5x every what 10 10x every 5 years that's easier easiest math 10x every 5 years a 100 times every 10 years 100 times every 10 years at the in the middle in the hey days of the PC Revolution one 100 times every 10 years in the last 8 years we've gone 1,000 times we have two more years to go and so that puts it in perspective the rate at which we're advancing Computing is insane and it's still not fast enough so we built another chip this chip is just an incredible chip we call it the Envy link switch it's 50 billion transistors it's almost the size of Hopper all by itself this switch ship has four MV links in it each 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 8 terabytes per second and and it has computation in as I mentioned what is this chip for if we were to build such a chip we can have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at full speed at the same time that's insane it doesn't even make sense but if you could do that if you can find a way to do that and build a system to do that that's cost effective that's cost effective how incredible would it be that we could have all these gpus connect over a coherent link so that they effectively are one giant GPU well one of one of the Great Inventions in order to make a cost effective is that this chip has to drive copper directly the seres of this chip is is just a phenomenal invention so that we could do direct drive to copper and as a result you can build a system that looks like this now this system this system is kind of insane this is one dgx this is what a dgx looks like now remember just six years ago it was pretty heavy but I was able to lift it I delivered the uh the uh first djx1 to open Ai and and the researchers there it's on you know the pictures are on the internet and uh uh and we all autographed it uh and um uh if you come to my office it's autographed there is really beautiful and but but you could lift it uh this dgx this dgx that djx by the way was 170 teraflops if you're not familiar with the numbering system that's 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 17 pedop flops so this is 720 the first one I delivered to open AI was 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 17 you could round it up to 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 2 won't make any difference but and back then was like wow you know 30 more teraflops and so this is now 720 pedop flops almost an exal flop for training and the world's first one exal flops machine in one rack just so you know there are only a couple two three exop flops machines on the planet as we speak and so this is an exop flops AI system in one single rack well let's take a look at the back of it so this is what makes it possible that's the back that's the that's the back the dgx MV link spine 130 terabytes per second goes through the back of that chassis that is more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet so we we could basically send everything to everybody within a second and so so we we have 5,000 cables 5,000 mvlink cables in total 2 miles now this is the amazing thing if we had to use Optics we would have had to use transceivers and retim and those transceivers and reers alone would have cost 20,000 watts 2 kilowatts of just transceivers alone just to drive the mvlink spine as a result we did it completely for free over mvlink switch and we were able to save the 20 kilow for computation this entire rack is 120 kilowatts so that 20 kilowatts makes a huge difference it's liquid cooled what goes in is 25° C about room temperature what comes out is 45°c about your jacuzzi so room temperature goes in jacuzzi comes out 2 liters per second we could we could sell a peripheral 600,000 Parts somebody used to say you know you guys make gpus and we do but this is what a GPU looks like to me when somebody says GPU I see this two years ago when I saw a GPU was the hgx it was 70 lb 35,000 Parts our gpus now are 600,000 parts and 3,000 lb 3,000 lb 3,000 lb that's kind of like the weight of a you know Carbon Fiber Ferrari I don't know if that's useful metric but everybody's going I feel it I feel it I get it I get that now that you mention that I feel it I don't know what's 3,000 lb okay so 3,000 lb ton and a half so it's not quite an elephant so this is what a dgx looks like now let's see what it looks like in operation okay let's imagine what is what how do we put this to work and what does that mean well if you were to train a GPT model 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 8 trillion parameter model it took it took about apparently about you know 3 to 5 months or so uh with 25,000 amp uh if we were to do it with hopper it would probably take something like 8,000 gpus and it would consume 15 megawatts 8,000 gpus on 15 megawatts it would take 90 days about 3 months and that would allows you to train something that is you know this groundbreaking AI model and this is obviously not as expensive as as um as anybody would think but it's 8,000 8,000 gpus it's still a lot of money and so 8,000 gpus 15 megawatts if you were to use Blackwell to do this it would only take 2,000 gpus 2,000 gpus same 90 days but this is the amazing part only 4 me GS of power so from 15 yeah that's right and that's and that's our goal our goal is to continuously drive down the cost and the energy they're directly proportional to each other cost and energy associated with the Computing so that we can continue to expand and scale up the computation that we have to do to train the Next Generation models well this is training inference or generation is vitally important going forward you know probably some half of the time that Nvidia gpus are in the cloud these days it's being used for token generation you know they're either doing co-pilot this or chat you know chat GPT that or um all these different models that are being used when you're interacting with it or generating IM generating images or generating videos generating proteins generating chemicals there's a bunch of gener generation going on all of that is B in the category of computing we call inference but inference is extremely hard for large language models because these large language models have several properties one they're very large and so it doesn't fit on one GPU this is Imagine imagine Excel doesn't fit on one GPU you know and imagine some application you're running on a daily basis doesn't run doesn't fit on one computer like a video game doesn't fit on one computer and most in fact do and many times in the past in hyperscale Computing many applic applications for many people fit on the same computer and now all of a sudden this one inference application where you're interacting with this chatbot that chatbot requires a supercomputer in the back to run it and that's the future the future is generative with these chatbots and these chatbots are trillions of tokens trillions of parameters and they have to generate tokens at interactive rates now what does that mean well uh three to tokens is about a word I you know the the uh you know space the final frontier these are the adventures that's like that's like 80 tokens okay I don't know if that's useful to you and so you know the art of communications is is selecting good an good analogies yeah this is this is not going well every I don't know what he's talking about never seen Star Trek and so and so so here we are we're trying to generate these tokens when you're interacting with it you're hoping that the tokens come back to you as quickly as possible and as quickly as you can read it and so the ability for Generation tokens is really important you have to paralyze the work of this model across many many gpus so that you could achieve several things one on the one hand you would like throughput because that throughput reduces the cost the overall cost per token of uh generating so your throughput dictates the cost of of uh delivering the service on the other hand you have another interactive rate which is another tokens per second where it's about per user and that has everything to do with quality of service and so these two things um uh compete against each other and we have to find a way to distribute work across all of these different gpus and paralyze it in a way that allows us to achieve both and it turns out the search search space is enormous you know I told you there's going to be math involved and everybody's going oh dear I heard some gasp just now when I put up that slide you know so so this this right here the the y axis is tokens per second data center throughput the x- axis is tokens per second interactivity of the person and notice the upper right is the best you want interactivity to be very High number of tokens per second per user you want the tokens per second of per data center to be very high the upper upper right is is terrific however it's very hard to do that and in order for us to search for the best answer across every single one of those intersections XY coordinates okay so you just look at every single XY coordinate all those blue dots came from some repartitioning of the software some optimizing solution has to go and figure out what whether to use use tensor parallel expert parallel pipeline parallel or data parallel and distribute this enormous model across all these G different gpus and sustain performance that you need this exploration space would be impossible if not for the programmability of nvidia's gpus and so we could because of Cuda because we have such Rich ecosystem we could explore this universe and find that green roof line it turns out that green roof line notice you got tp2 EPA dp4 it means two parall two uh tensor parallel tensor parallel across two gpus expert parallels across eight data parallel across four notice on the other end you got tensor parallel cross 4 and expert parallel across 16 the configuration the distribution of that software it's a different different um runtime that would produce these different results and you have to go discover that roof line well that's just one model and this is just one configuration of a computer imagine all of the models being created around the world and all the different different um uh configurations of of uh systems that are going to be available so now that you understand the basics let's take a look at inference of Blackwell compared to Hopper and this is this is the extraordinary thing in one generation because we created a system that's designed for trillion parameter gener generative AI the inference capability of Blackwell is off the charts and in fact it is some 30 times Hopper y for large language models for large language models like Chad GPT and others like it the blue line is Hopper I gave you imagine we didn't change the architecture of Hopper we just made it a bigger chip we just used the latest you know greatest uh 10 terab you know terabytes per second we connected the two chips together we got this giant 208 billion parameter chip how would we have performed if nothing else changed and it turns out quite wonderfully quite wonderfully and that's the purple line but not as great as it could be and and that's where the fp4 tensor core the new Transformer engine and very importantly the MV link switch and the reason for that is because all these gpus have to share the results partial products whenever they do all to all all all gather whenever they communicate with each other that mvlink switch is communicating almost 10 times faster than what we could do in the past using the fastest networks Okay so Blackwell is going to be just an amazing system for a generative Ai and in the future in the future data centers are going to be thought of as I mentioned earlier as an AI Factory an AI Factory's goal in life is to generate revenues generate in this case intelligence in this facility not generating electricity as in AC generator but of the last Industrial Revolution and this Industrial Revolution the generation of intelligence and so this ability is super super important the excitement of Blackwell is really off the charts you know when we first when we first um uh you know this this is a year and a half ago two years ago I guess two years ago when we first started to to go to market with hopper you know we had the benefit of of uh two two uh two csps uh joined us in a lunch and and we were you know delighted um and so we had two customers uh we have more now unbelievable excitement for Blackwell unbelievable excitement and there's a whole bunch of different configurations of course I showed you the configurations that slide into the hopper form factor so that's easy to upgrade I showed you examples that are liquid cooled that are the extreme versions of it one entire rack that's that's uh connected by mvlink 72 uh we're going to Blackwell is going to be ramping to the world's AI companies of which there are so many now doing amazing work in different modalities the csps every CSP is geared up all the OEM and odms Regional clouds Sovereign AIS and Telos all over the world are signing up to launch with Blackwell this Blackwell Blackwell would be the the the most successful product launch in our history and so I can't wait wait to see that um I want to thank I want to thank some partners that that are joining us in this uh AWS is gearing up for Blackwell they're uh they're going to build the first uh GPU with secure AI they're uh building out a 222 exf flops system you know just now when we animated uh just now the digital twin if you saw the the all of those clusters are coming down by the way that is not just art that is a digital twin of what we're building that's how big it's going to be besides infrastructure we're doing a lot of things together with AWS we're Cuda accelerating stag maker AI we're Cuda accelerating Bedrock AI uh Amazon robotics is working with us uh using Nvidia Omniverse and Isaac Sim AWS Health has Nvidia Health Integrated into it so AWS has has really leaned into accelerated Computing uh Google is gearing up for Blackwell gcp already has A1 100s h100s t4s l4s a whole Fleet of Nvidia Cuda gpus and they recently announced the Gemma model that runs across all of it uh we're work working to optimize uh and accelerate every aspect of gcp we're accelerating data proc which for data processing their data processing engine Jax xlaa vertex Ai and mojoko for robotics so we're working with uh Google and gcp across a whole bunch of initiatives uh Oracle is gearing up for black wellth Oracle is a great partner of ours for Nvidia dgx cloud and we're also working together to accelerate something that's really important to a lot of companies Oracle database Microsoft is accelerating and Microsoft is gearing up for Blackwell Microsoft Nvidia has a wide- ranging partnership we're accelerating Cuda accelerating all kinds of services when you when you chat obviously and uh AI services that are in Microsoft Azure uh it's very very likely Nvidia is in the back uh doing the inference and the token generation uh we built they built the largest Nvidia infiniband supercomputer basically a digital twin of hours or a physical twin of hours uh we're bringing the Nvidia ecosystem to Azure Nvidia djx cloud to Azure uh Nvidia Omniverse is now hosted in Azure Nvidia Healthcare is an Azure and all of it is deeply integrated and deeply connected with Microsoft fabric the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell this is what I'm about to show you most of the most of the the the uh uh uh scenes that you've seen so far of Blackwell are the are the full Fidelity design of Blackwell everything in our company has a digital twin and in fact this digital twin idea is it is really spreading and it it helps it helps companies build very complicated things perfectly the first time and what could be more exciting than creating a digital twin to build a computer that was built in a digital twin and so let me show you what wistron is doing to meet the demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing widraw one of our leading manufacturing Partners is building digital twins of Nvidia dgx and hgx factories using custom software developed with Omniverse sdks and apis for their newest Factory wraw started with a digital twin to virtually integrate their multi-ad and process simulation data into a unified view testing and optimizing layouts in this physically accurate digital environment increased worker efficency icy by 51% during construction the Omniverse digital twin was used to verify that the physical build matched the digital plans identifying any discrepancies early has helped avoid costly change orders and the results have been impressive using a digital twin helped bring wion's Factory online in half the time just 2 and 1/2 months instead of five in operation the Omniverse digital twin helps widraw rapidly Test new layouts to accommodate new processes or improve operations in the existing space and monitor real-time operations using live iot data from every machine on the production line which ultimately enabled wion to reduce End to-end Cycle Times by 50% and defect rates by 40% with Nvidia Ai and Omniverse nvidia's Global ecosystem of partners are building a new era of accelerated AI enabled digitalization that's how we that's the way it's going to be in the future we're going to manufacturing everything digitally first and then we'll manufacture it physically people ask me how did it start what got you guys so excited what was it that you saw that caused you to put it all in on this incredible idea and it's this hang on a second guys that was going to be such a moment that's what happens when you don't rehearse this as you know was first Contact 20 12 alexnet you put a cat into this computer and it comes out and it says cat and we said oh my God this is going to change everything you take 1 million numbers you take one Million numbers across three channels RGB these numbers make no sense to anybody you put it into this software and it compress it dimensionally reduce it it reduces it from a million dimensions a million Dimensions it turns it into three letters one vector one number and it's generalized you could have the cat be different cats and and you could have it be the front of the cat and the back of the cat and you look at this thing you say unbelievable you mean any cats yeah any cat and it was able to recognize all these cats and we realized how it did it systematically structurally it's scalable how big can you make it well how big do you want to make it and so we imagine that this is a completely new way of writing software and now today as you know you could have you type in the word c a and what comes out is a cat it went the other way am I right unbelievable how is it possible that's right how is it possible you took three letters and you generated a million pixels from it and it made sense well that's the miracle and here we are just literally 10 years later 10 years later where we recognize textt we recognize images we recognize videos and sounds and images not only do we recognize them we understand their meaning we understand the meaning of the text that's the reason why it can chat with you it can summarize for you it understands the text it understood not just recognizes the the English it understood the English it doesn't just recognize the pixels and understood the pixels and you can you can even condition it between two modalities you can have language condition image and generate all kinds of interesting things well if you can understand these things what else can you understand that you've digitized the reason why we started with text and you know images is because we digitized those but what else have we digitized well it turns out we digitized a lot of things proteins and genes and brain waves anything you can digitize so long as there's structure we can probably learn some patterns from it and if we can learn the patterns from it we can understand its meaning if we can understand its meaning we might be able to generate it as well and so therefore the generative AI Revolution is here well what else can we generate what else can we learn well one of the things that we would love to learn we would love to learn is we would love to learn climate we would love to learn extreme weather we would love to learn uh what how we can predict future weather at Regional scales at sufficiently high resolution such that we can keep people out of Harm's Way before harm comes extreme weather cost the world $150 billion surely more than that and it's not evenly distributed $150 billion is concentrated in some parts of the world and of course to some people of the world we need to adapt and we need to know what's coming and so we are creating Earth too a digital twin of the Earth for predicting weather we and we've made an extraordinary invention called Civ the ability to use generative AI to predict weather at extremely high resolution let's take a look as the earth's climate changes AI powered weather forecasting is allowing us to more accurately predict and track severe storms like super typhoon chanthu which caused widespread damage in Taiwan and the surrounding region in 2021 current AI forecast models can accurately predict the track of storms but they are limited to 25 km resolution which can miss important details Invidia cordi is a revolutionary new generative AI model trained on high resolution radar assimilated Warf weather forecasts and air 5 reanalysis data using cordi extreme events like chanthu can be super resolved from 25 km to 2 km resolution with 1,000 times the speed and 3,000 times the Energy Efficiency of conventional weather models by combining the speed and accuracy of nvidia's weather forecasting model forecast net and generative AI models like cordi we can explore hundreds or even thousands of kilometer scale Regional weather forecasts to provide a clear picture of the best worst and most likely impacts of a storm this wealth of information can help minimize loss of life and property damage today cordi is optimized for Taiwan but soon generative super sampling will be available as part of the in viia Earth 2 inference service for many regions across the globe the weather company has the trust a source of global weather predictions we are working together to accelerate their weather simulation first principled base of simulation however they're also going to integrate Earth to cordi so that they could help businesses and countries do Regional high resolution weather prediction and so if you have some weather prediction you'd like to know like to do uh reach out to the weather company really exciting really exciting work Nvidia Healthcare something we started 15 years ago we're super super excited about this this is an area where we're very very proud whether it's Medical Imaging or genene sequencing or computational chemistry it is very likely that Nvidia is the computation behind it we've done so much work in this area today we're announcing that we're going to do something really really cool imagine all of these AI models that are being used to generate images and audio but instead of images and audio because it understood images and audio all the digitization that we've done for genes and proteins and amino acids that digitalization capability is now now passed through machine learning so that we understand the language of Life the ability to understand the language of Life of course we saw the first evidence of it with alphafold this is really quite an extraordinary thing after Decades of painstaking work the world had only digitized and reconstructed using cor electron microscopy or Crystal XR x-ray crystallography um these different techniques painstaking reconstructed the protein 200,000 of them in just what is it less than a year or so Alpha fold has reconstructed 200 million proteins basically every protein every of every living thing that's ever been sequenced this is completely revolutionary well those models are incredibly hard to use um for incredibly hard for people to build and so what we're going to do is we're going to build them we're going to build them for uh the the researchers around the world and it won't be the only one there'll be many other models that we create and so let me show you what we're going to do with it virtual screening for new medicines is a computationally intractable problem existing techniques can only scan billions of compounds and require days on thousands of standard compute nodes to identify new drug candidates Nvidia biion Nemo Nims enable a new generative screening Paradigm using Nims for protein structure prediction with Alpha fold molecule generation with MIM and docking with diff dock we can now generate and Screen candidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM can connect to custom applications to steer the generative process iteratively optimizing for desired properties these applications can be defined with biion Nemo microservices or built from scratch here a physics based simulation optimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to a Target protein while optimizing for other favorable molecular properties in parallel MIM generates high quality drug-like molecules that bind to the Target and are synthesizable translating to a higher probability of developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with Nims providing OnDemand microservices that can be combined to build powerful drug Discovery workflows like denovo protein design or ided molecule generation for virtual screening bio Nims are helping researchers and developers reinvent computational drug design Nvidia M MIM MIM cord diff there's a whole bunch of other models whole bunch of other models computer vision models robotics models and even of course some really really terrific open source language models these models are groundbreaking however it's hard for companies to use how would you use it how would you bring it into your company and integrate it into your workflow how would you package it up and run it remember earlier I just said that inference is an extraordinary computation problem how would you do the optimization for each and every one of these models and put together the Computing stack necessary to run that supercomputer so that you can run the models in your company and so we have a great idea we're going to invent a new way invent a new way for you to receive and operate software this software comes basically in a digital box we call it a container and we call it the Nvidia inference micr service a Nim and let me explain to you what it is a Nim it's a pre-trained model so it's pretty clever and it is packaged and optimized to run across nvidia's install base which is very very large what's inside it is incredible you have all these pre-trained state-ofthe-art open source models they could be open source they could be from one of our partners it could be created by us like Nvidia mull it is packaged up with all of its dependencies so Cuda the right version CNN the right version tensor RT llm Distributing across the multiple gpus Tred and inference server all completely packaged together it's optimized depending on whether you have a single GPU multi- GPU or multi node of gpus it's optimized for that and it's connected up with apis that are simple to use now this think about what an AI API is an AI API is an interface that you just talk to and so this is a piece of software in the future that has a really simple API and that API called human and these packages incredible bodies of software will be optimized and packaged and we'll put it on a website and you can download it you could take it with you you could run it in any Cloud you can run it in your own data center you can run in workstations if it fit and all you have to do is come to ai\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  nvidia\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: com we call it Nvidia inference microservice but inside the company we all call it Nims okay just imagine you know one of some someday there there's going to be one of these chat Bots and these chat Bots is going to just be in a Nim and you you'll uh you'll assemble a whole bunch of chat Bots and that's the way software is going to be be built someday how do we build software in the future it is unlikely that you'll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of python code or anything like that it is very likely that you assemble a team of AIS there's probably going to be a super AI that you use that takes the mission that you give it and breaks it down into an execution plan some of that execution plan could be handed off to another Nim that Nim would maybe uh understand sap the language of sap is abap it might understand service now and it go retrieve some information from their platforms it might then hand that result to another Nim who that goes off and does some calculation on it maybe it's an optimization software a combinatorial optimization algorithm maybe it's uh you know some just some basic calculator maybe it's pandas to do some numerical analysis on it and then it comes back with its answer and it gets combined with everybody else's and it because it's been presented with this is what the right answer should look like it knows what answer what an what right answers to produce and it presents it to you we can get a report every single day at you know top of the hour uh that has something to do with a bill plan or some forecast or uh some customer alert or some bugs database or whatever it happens to be and we could assemble it using all these Nims and because these Nims have been packaged up and ready to work on your systems so long as you have video gpus in your data center in the cloud this this Nims will work together as a team and do amazing things and so we decided this is such a great idea we're going to go do that and so Nvidia has Nims running all over the company we have chatbots being created all over the place and one of the mo most important chatbots of course is a chip designer chatbot you might not be surprised we care a lot about building chips and so we want to build chatbots AI co-pilots that are co-designers with our engineers and so this is the way we did it so we got ourselves a llama llama 2 this is a 70b and it's you know packaged up in a NM and we asked it you know uh what is a CTL Well turns out CTL is an internal uh program and it has a internal proprietary language but it thought the CTL was a combinatorial timing logic and so it describes you know conventional knowledge of CTL but that's not very useful to us and so we gave it a whole bunch of new examples you know this is no different than employee onboarding an employee uh we say you know thanks for that answer it's completely wrong um and and uh and then we present to them uh this is what a CTL is okay and so this is what a CTL is at Nvidia and the CTL as you can see you know CTL stands for compute Trace Library which makes sense you know we were tracing compute Cycles all the time and it wrote the program isn't that amazing and so the productivity of our chip designers can go up this is what you can do with a Nim first thing you can do with is customize it we have a service called Nemo microservice that helps you curate the data preparing the data so that you could teach this on board this AI you fine-tune them and then you guardrail it you can even evaluate the answer evaluate its performance against um other other examples and so that's called the Nemo micr service now the thing that's that's emerging here is this there are three elements three pillars of what we're doing the first pillar is of course inventing the technology for um uh AI models and running AI models and packaging it up for you the second is to create tools to help you modify it first is having the AI technology second is to help you modify it and third is infrastructure for you to fine-tune it and if you like deploy it you could deploy it on our infrastructure called dgx cloud or you can employ deploy it on Prem you can deploy it anywhere you like once you develop it it's yours to take anywhere and so we are effectively an AI Foundry we will do for you and the industry on AI what tsmc does for us building chips and so we go to it with our go to tsmc with our big Ideas they manufacture and we take it with us and so exactly the same thing here AI Foundry and the three pillar ERS are the NIMS Nemo microservice and dgx Cloud the other thing that you could teach the Nim to do is to understand your proprietary information remember inside our company the vast majority of our data is not in the cloud it's inside our company it's been sitting there you know being used all the time and and gosh it's it's basically invidious intelligence we would like to take that data learn its meaning like we learned the meaning of almost anything else that we just talked about learn its meaning and then reindex that knowledge into a new type of database called a vector database and so you essentially take structured data or unstructured data you learn its meaning you encode its meaning so now this becomes an AI database and that AI database in the future once you create it you can talk to it and so let me give you an example of what you could do so suppose you create you get you got a whole bunch of multi modality data and one good example of that is PDF so you take the PDF you take all of your PDFs all the all your favorite you know the stuff that that is proprietary to you critical to your company you can encode it just as we encoded pixels of a cat and it becomes the word cat we can encode all of your PDF and it turns into vectors that are now stored inside your vector database it becomes the proprietary information of your company and once you have that proprietary information you can chat to it it's an it's a smart database and so you just ch chat with data and how how much more enjoyable is that you know we for for our software team you know they just chat with the bugs database you know how many bugs was there last night um are we making any progress and then after you're done talking to this uh bugs database you need therapy and so so we have another chatbot for you you can do it okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the reason for that is because ultimately it's job is to go retrieve information as quickly as possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve me this information it goes if brings it back to you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay and so we call it the Nemo retriever well the Nemo service helps you create all these things and we have all all these different Nims we even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel your AI care manager okay so so it's a really short clip but there were so many videos to show you I guess so many other demos to show you and so I I had to cut this one short but this is Diana she is a digital human Nim and and uh you just talked to her and she's connected in this case to Hippocratic ai's large language model for healthcare and it's truly amazing she is just super smart about Healthcare things you know and so after you're done after my my Dwight my VP of software engineering talks to the chatbot for bugs database then you come over here and talk to Diane and and so so uh Diane is is um completely animated with AI and she's a digital human uh there's so many companies that would like to build they're sitting on gold mines the the Enterprise IT industry is sitting on a gold mine it's a gold mine because they have so much understanding of of uh the way work is done they have all these amazing tools that have been created over the years and they're sitting on a lot of data if they could take that gold mine and turn them into co-pilots these co-pilots could help us do things and so just about every it franchise it platform in the world that has valuable tools that people use is sitting on a gold mine for co-pilots and they would like to build their own co-pilots and their own chatbots and so we're announcing that Nvidia AI foundary is working with some of the world's great companies sap generates 87% of the world's Global Commerce basically the world runs on sap we run on sap Nvidia and sap are building sap Jewel co-pilots uh using Nvidia Nemo and dgx cloud service now they run 80 85% of the world's Fortune 500 companies run their people and customer service operations on service now and they're using Nvidia AI Foundry to build service now uh assist virtual assistance cohesity backs up the world's data they're sitting on a gold mine of data hundreds of exobytes of data over 10,000 companies Nvidia AI Foundry is working with them helping them build their Gaia generative AI agent snowflake is a company that stores the world's uh digital Warehouse in the cloud and serves over 3 billion queries a day for 10,000 Enterprise customers snowflake is working with Nvidia AI Foundry to build co-pilots with Nvidia Nemo and Nims net apppp nearly half of the files in the world are stored on Prem on net apppp Nvidia AI Foundry is helping them uh build chat Bots and co-pilots like those Vector databases and retrievers with Nvidia neemo and Nims and we have a great partnership with Dell everybody who everybody who is building these chat Bots and generative AI when you're ready to run it you're going to need an AI Factory and nobody is better at Building end-to-end Systems of very large scale for the Enterprise than Dell and so anybody any company every company will need to build AI factories and it turns out that Michael is here he's happy to take your order ladies and gentlemen Michael del okay let's talk about the next wave of Robotics the next wave of AI robotics physical AI so far all of the AI that we've talked about is one computer data comes into one computer lots of the world's if you will experience in digital text form the AI imitates Us by reading a lot of the language to predict the next words it's imitating You by studying all of the patterns and all the other previous examples of course it has to understand context and so on so forth but once it understands the context it's essentially imitating you we take all of the data we put it into a system like dgx we compress it into a large language model trillions and trillions of parameters become billions and billion trillions of tokens becomes billions of parameters these billions of parameters becomes your AI well in order for us to go to the next wave of AI where the AI understands the physical world we're going to need three computers the first computer is still the same computer it's that AI computer that now is going to be watching video and maybe it's doing synthetic data generation and maybe there's a lot of human examples just as we have human examples in text form we're going to have human examples in articulation form and the AIS will watch us understand what is happening and try to adapt it for themselves into the context and because it can generalize with these Foundation models maybe these robots can also perform in the physical world fairly generally so I just described in very simple terms essentially what just happened in large language models except the chat GPT moment for robotics may be right around the corner and so we've been building the end to-end systems for robotics for some time I'm super super proud of the work we have the AI system dgx we have the lower system which is called agx for autonomous systems the world's first robotics processor when we first built this thing people are what are you guys building it's a s so it's one chip it's designed to be very low power but it's designed for high-speed sensor processing and Ai and so if you want to run Transformers in a car or you want to run Transformers in a in a you know anything um that moves uh we have the perfect computer for you it's called the Jetson and so the dgx on top for training the AI the Jetson is the autonomous processor and in the middle we need another computer whereas large language models have the benefit of you providing your examples and then doing reinforcement learning human feedback what is the reinforcement learning human feedback of a robot well it's reinforcement learning physical feedback that's how you align the robot that's how you that's how the robot knows that as it's learning these articulation capabilities and manipulation capabilities it's going to adapt properly into the laws of physics and so we need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot we call that virtual world Omniverse and the computer that runs Omniverse is called ovx and ovx the computer itself is hosted in the Azure Cloud okay and so basically we built these three things these three systems on top of it we have algorithms for every single one now I'm going to show you one super example of how Ai and Omniverse are going to work together the example I'm going to show you is kind of insane but it's going to be very very close to tomorrow it's a robotics building this robotics building is called a warehouse inside the robotics building are going to be some autonomous systems some of the autonomous systems are going to be called humans and some of the autonomous systems are going to be called forklifts and these autonomous systems are going to interact with each other of course autonomously and it's going to be overlooked upon by this Warehouse to keep everybody out of Harm's Way the warehouse is essentially an air traffic controller and whenever it sees something happening it will redirect traffic traffic and give New Way points just new way points to the robots and the people and they'll know exactly what to do this warehouse this building you can also talk to of course you could talk to it hey you know sap Center how are you feeling today for example and so you could ask the same the warehouse the same questions basically the system I just described will have Omniverse Cloud that's hosting the virtual simulation and AI running on djx cloud and all of this is running in real time let's take a look the future of heavy industri starts as a digital twin the AI agents helping robots workers and infrastructure navigate unpredictable events in complex industrial spaces will be built and evaluated first in sophisticated digital twins this Omniverse digital twin of a 100,000 ft Warehouse is operating as a simulation environment that integrates digital workers amrs running the Nvidia Isaac receptor stack centralized activity maps of the entire Warehouse from 100 simulated ceiling mount cameras using Nvidia metropolis and AMR route planning with Nvidia Koop software in Loop testing of AI agents in this physically accurate simulated environment enables us to evaluate and refine how the system adapts to real world unpredictability here an incident occurs along this amr's planned route blocking its path as it moves to pick up a pallet Nvidia Metropolis updates and sends a realtime occupancy map to kopt where a new optimal route is calculated the AMR is enabled to see around corners and improve its Mission efficiency with generative AI powered Metropolis Vision Foundation models operators can even ask questions using natural language the visual model understands nuanced activity and can offer immediate insights to improve operations all of the sensor data is created in simulation and passed to the real-time AI running as Nvidia inference microservices or Nims and when the AI is ready to be deployed in the physical twin the real Warehouse we connect metropolis and Isaac Nims to real sensors with the ability for continuous Improvement of both the digital twin and the AI models isn't that incredible and so remember remember a future facility Warehouse Factory building will be software defined and so the software is running how else would you test the software so you you you test the software to building the warehouse the optimization system in the digital twin what about all the robots all of those robots you are seeing just now they're all running their own autonomous robotic stack and so the way you integrate software in the future cicd in the future for robotic systems is with digital twins we've made Omniverse a lot easier to access we're going to create basically Omniverse Cloud apis four simple API and a channel and you can connect your application to it so this is this is going to be as wonderfully beautifully simple in the future that Omniverse is going to be and with these apis you're going to have these magical digital twin capability we also have turned om ver into an AI and integrated it with the ability to chat USD the the language of our language is you know human and Omniverse is language as it turns out is universal scene description and so that language is rather complex and so we've taught our Omniverse uh that language and so you can speak to it in English and it would directly generate USD and it would talk back in USD but Converse back to you in English you could also look for information in this world semantically instead of the world being encoded semantically in in language now it's encoded semantically in scenes and so you could ask it of of uh certain objects or certain conditions and certain scenarios and it can go and find that scenario for you it also can collaborate with you in generation you could design some things in 3D it could simulate some things in 3D or you could use AI to generate something in 3D let's take a look at how this is all going to work we have a great partnership with Seamans Seamans is the world's largest industrial engineering and operations platform you've seen now so many different companies in the industrial space heavy Industries is one of the greatest final frontiers of it and we finally now have the Necessary Technology to go and make a real impact seens is building the industrial metaverse and today we're announcing that Seamans is connecting their Crown Jewel accelerator to Nvidia Omniverse let's take a look seens technology is transformed every day for everyone team Center acts our leading product life cycle management software from the sems accelerator platform is used every day by our customers to develop and deliver products at scale now we are bringing the real and the digital worlds even Closer by integrating Nvidia Ai and Omniverse Technologies into team Center X Omniverse apis enable data interoperability and physics-based rendering to Industrial scale design and Manufacturing projects our customers HD market leader in sustainable ship manufacturing builds ammonia and hydrogen power chips often comprising over 7 million discrete Parts with Omniverse apis team Center X lets companies like HD yundai unify and visualize these massive engineering data sets interactively and integrate generative AI to generate 3D objects or HDR I backgrounds to see their projects in context the result an ultra inuitive photoal physics-based digital twin that eliminates waste and errors delivering huge savings in cost and time and we are building this for collaboration whether across more semens accelerator tools like seens anex or Star CCM Plus or across teams working on their favorite devices in the same scene together in this is just the beginning working with Nvidia we will bring accelerated Computing generative Ai and Omniverse integration across the Sean accelerator portfolio the pro the the professional the professional voice actor happens to be a good friend of mine Roland Bush who happens to be the CEO of seens once you get Omniverse connected into your workflow your ecosystem from the beginning of your design to engineering to manufacturing planning all the way to digital twin operations once you connect everything together it's insane how much productivity you can get and it's just really really wonderful all of a sudden everybody is operating on the same ground truth you don't have to exchange data and convert data make mistakes everybody is working on the same ground truth from the design Department to the art Department the architecture Department all the way to the engineering and even the marketing department let's take a look at how Nissan has integrated Omniverse into their workflow and it's all because it's connected by all these wonderful tools and these developers that we're working with take a look unbel for for that was not an animation that was Omniverse today we're announcing that Omniverse Cloud streams to The Vision Pro and it is very very strange that you walk around virtual doors when I was getting out of that car and everybody does it it is really really quite amazing Vision Pro connected to Omniverse portals you into Omniverse and because all of these CAD tools and all these different design tools are now integrated and connected to Omniverse you can have this type of workflow really incredible let's talk about robotics everything that moves will be robotic there's no question about that it's safer it's more convenient and one of the largest Industries is going to be Automotive we build the robotic stack from top to bottom as I was mentioned from the computer system but in the case of self-driving cars including the self-driving application at the end of this year or I guess beginning of next year we will be shipping in Mercedes and then shortly after that jlr and so these autonomous robotic systems are software defined they take a lot of work to do has computer vision has obviously artificial intelligence control and planning all kinds of very complicated technology and takes years to refine we're building the entire stack however we open up our entire stack for all of the automotive industry this is just the way we work the way we work in every single industry we try to build as much of it as we can so that we understand it but then we open it up so everybody can access it whether you would like to buy just our computer which is the world's only full functional save asld system that can run AI this functional safe asld quality computer or the operating system on top or of course our data centers which is in basically every AV company in the world however you would like to enjoy it we're delighted by it today we're announcing that byd the world's largest ev company is adopting our next Generation it's called Thor Thor is designed for Transformer engines Thor our next Generation AV computer will be used by byd you probably don't know this fact that we have over a million robotics developers we created Jetson this robotics computer we're so proud of it the amount of software that goes on top of it is insane but the reason why we can do it at all is because it's 100% Cuda compatible everything that we do everything that we do in our company is in service of our developers and by us being able to maintain this Rich ecosystem and make it compatible with everything that you access from us we can bring all of that incredible capability to this little tiny computer we call Jetson a robotics computer we also today are announcing this incredibly Advanced new SDK we call it Isaac perceptor Isaac perceptor most most of the Bots today are pre-programmed they're either following rails on the ground digital rails or theyd be following April tags but in the future they're going to have perception and the reason why you want that is so that you could easily program it you say would you like to go from point A to point B and it will figure out a way to navigate its way there so by only programming waypoints the entire route could be adaptive the entire environment could be reprogrammed just as I showed you at the very beginning with the warehouse you can't do that with pre-programmed agvs if those boxes fall down they just all gum up and they just wait there for somebody to come clear it and so now with the Isaac perceptor we have incredible state-of-the-art Vision odometry 3D reconstruction and in addition to 3D reconstruction depth perception the reason for that is so that you can have two modalities to keep an eye on what's happening in the world Isaac perceptor the most used robot today is the manipulator manufacturing arms and they are also pre-programmed the computer vision algorithms the AI algorithms the control and path planning algorithms that are geometry aware incredibly computational intensive we have made these Cuda accelerated so we have the world's first Cuda accelerated motion planner that is geometry aware you put something in front of it it comes up with a new plan and our articulates around it it has excellent perception for pose estimation of a 3D object not just not it's pose in 2D but it's pose in 3D so it has to imagine what's around and how best to grab it so the foundation pose the grip foundation and the um articulation algorithms are now available we call it Isaac manipulator and they also uh just run on nvidia's computers we are are starting to do some really great work in the next generation of Robotics the next generation of Robotics will likely be a humanoid robotics we now have the Necessary Technology and as I was describing earlier the Necessary Technology to imagine generalized human robotics in a way human robotics is likely easier and the reason for that is because we have a lot more imitation training data that we can provide there robots because we are constructed in a very similar way it is very likely that the human robotics will be much more useful in our world because we created the world to be something that we can interoperate in and work well in and the way that we set up our workstations and Manufacturing and Logistics they were designed for for humans they were designed for people and so these human robotics will likely be much more productive to deploy while we're creating just like we're doing with the others the entire stack starting from the top a foundation model that learns from watching video human IM human examples it could be in video form it could be in virtual reality form we then created a gym for it called Isaac reinforcement learning gym which allows the humanoid robot to learn how to adapt to the physical world and then an incredible computer the same computer that's going to go into a robotic car this computer will run inside a human or robot called Thor it's designed for Transformer engines we've combined several of these into one video this is something that you're going to really love take a look it's not enough for humans to imagine we have to invent and explore real and push Beyond what's been done fair amount of detail we create smarter and faster we push it to fail so it can learn we teach it then help it teach itself we broaden its understanding to take on new challenges with absolute precision and succeed we make it perceive and move and even reason so it can share our world with us this is where inspiration leads us the next Frontier this is Nvidia Project Groot a general purpose Foundation model for humanoid robot learning the group model takes multimodal instructions and past interactions as input and produces the next action for the robot to execute we developed Isaac lab a robot learning application to train gr on Omniverse Isaac Sim and we scale out with osmo a new compute orchestration service that coordinates work flows across dgx systems for training and ovx systems for simulation with these tools we can train Groot in physically based simulation and transfer zero shot to the real world the Groot model will enable a robot to learn from a handful of human demonstrations so it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us this is made possible with nvidia's technologies that can understand humans from videos train models and simulation and ultimately deploy them directly to physical robots connecting group to a large language model even allows it to generate motions by following natural language instructions hi go1 can you give me a high five sure thing let's high five can you give us some cool moves sure check this out all this incredible intelligence is powered by the new Jetson Thor robotics chips designed for Groot built for the future with Isaac lab osmo and Groot we're providing the building blocks for the next generation of AI powered robotics about the same size the soul of Nvidia the intersection of computer Graphics physics artificial intelligence it all came to bear at this moment the name of that project general robotics 003 I know super good super good well I think we have some special guests do we hey guys so I understand you guys are powered by Jetson they're powered by Jetson little Jetson robotics computers inside they learn to walk in Isaac Sim ladies and gentlemen this this is orange and this is the famous green they are the bdx robots of Disney amazing Disney research come on you guys let's wrap up let's go five things where you going I sit right here Don't Be Afraid come here green hurry up what are you saying no it's not time to eat it's not time to I'll I'll give you a snack in a moment let me finish up real quick come on green hurry up stop wasting time five things five things first a new Industrial Revolution every data center should be accelerated a trillion dollars worth of installed data centers will become modernized over the next several years second because of the computational capability we brought to bear a new way of doing software has emerged generative AI which is going to create new in new infrastructure dedicated to doing one thing and one thing only not for multi-user data centers but AI generators these AI generation will create incredibly valuable software a new Industrial Revolution second the computer of this revolution the computer of this generation generative AI trillion parameters blackw insane amounts of computers and computing third I'm trying to concentrate good job third new computer new computer creates new types of software new type of software should be distributed in a new way so that it can on the one hand be an endpoint in the cloud and easy to use but still allow you to take it with you because it is your intelligence your intelligence should be pack packaged up in a way that allows you to take it with you we call them Nims and third these Nims are going to help you create a new type of application for the future not one that you wrote completely from scratch but you're going to integrate them like teams create these applications we have a fantastic capability between Nims the AI technology the tools Nemo and the infrastructure dgx cloud in our AI Foundry to help you create proprietary applications proprietary chat Bots and then lastly everything that moves in the future will be robotic you're not going to be the only one and these robotic systems whether they are humanoid amrs self-driving cars forklifts manipulating arms they will all need one thing Giant stadiums warehouses factories there can to be factories that are robotic orchestrating factories uh manufacturing lines that are robotics building cars that are robotics these systems all need one thing they need a platform a digital platform a digital twin platform and we call that Omniverse the operating system of the robotics World these are the five things that we talked about today what does Nvidia look like what does Nvidia look like when we talk about gpus there's a very different image that I have when I when people ask me about gpus first I see a bunch of software stacks and things like that and second I see this this is what we announce to you today this is Blackwell this is the plat amazing amazing processors MV link switches networking systems and the system design is a miracle this is Blackwell and this to me is what a GPU looks like in my mind listen orange green I think we have one more treat for everybody what do you think should we okay we have one more thing to show you roll it he m yeah thank you thank you have a great have a great GTC thank you all for coming thank you Build me

only companyin computing who did not want to replace the CPU,but to augment the CPU, so that we can take the workloadsthat are very computationally intensive and offload them onto the GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  These are GPUs, that's the CPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Working together, we can take advantage of the bestcapabilities of both processors, one that is extremely good atsequential processing, the CPU, and a processor that's incredibly goodat parallel processing, called the GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  This I'll talk about in just a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  But this is accelerated computing\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Not just parallel computing,but accelerated computing\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  CPU and GPU working together\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This computing model is brand new to the world\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  In fact, just using the CPU has been around since 1964,the year after my birth\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  60 years in the making\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The vast majority of everything we see in the world todayrunning on computers are running on CPUs\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  But there's a new change, a fundamentalchange in the computing model\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  But in order to do that,you cannot just take the CPU software that's running sequentiallyand put it on a GPU to run parallel\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We have to create a whole bunch of newalgorithms\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Just as OpenGL made it possible for computergraphics applications to connect to accelerationthrough the graphics processor, we had to create many domain-specific libraries like OpenGL,but for many different applications\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  These are some of the 350 different libraries we have in our company,some very, very important libraries\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  CuLitho was for computational lithography,takes computational lithography\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Making the mask of chips may require many, many weeksbecause there are so many layers\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We take many weeks of computationand reduce it down to hours\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We could, of course,speed up the cycle time of building chips, but very importantly,we also make it possible to advance the algorithms of lithographymuch, much more sophisticated so that we canadvance semiconductor physics well beyond two nanometers,one nanometer and beyond\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  So computational lithographyis going to be accelerated by cuLitho\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  CuDSS for Sparse Solver, AI Aerial— I'll talk about that today\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  An incredible new library that makes it possiblefor this computer to run the 5G radio stack\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Basically a radio in real timerunning on the CUDA accelerator\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  CUDA-Q for quantum simulation, quantumcircuit simulations, Parabricks for gene sequencing, cuVS for vector storage,or vector databases for indexing and queryingvector databases that is used for AI\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  CuPyNumeric is a numerical processing library\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  NumPy is the most popularnumerical

CuPyNumeric, please go look it up\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: It's incredible\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  CuDF for data frame processing, structured data processinglike SQL, Pandas, Polars\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  CuOPT, the classic incredibly complicatedtraveling salesperson problem\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  This problem has now been acceleratedfor CuOPT, hundreds of times faster\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Modulus for AI physics, and then one of the most importantlibraries we ever created, called cuDNN\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes the different layers, the various layersof the deep learning stack\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It enabled usto do something extraordinary\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  By creating cuDNN, and acceleratingand democratizing deep learning, we made it possible in the last decade to scale artificial intelligence and scale machine learning by 1 million times\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Increasing the scale of machine learningby 1 million times enabled, of course, the incredible breakthroughthat we now know—ChatGPT\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The advent of artificial intelligence\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  CuDNN did something very special\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  It enabled a change in the way that software is done\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  This is the way that software was donebefore\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Software programmers writing code to describe an algorithm—that's a function\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  That function is software\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  You then apply input, it predicts an output\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  That code written by human runsbest on CPUs\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 was coding, writing software that runs on CPUs\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Software 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0, because the computer is now so incredibly fast, you can give it an enormous amount of examples—observed data— so that it can learn, it can predictwhat the function is by itself\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We call that software 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So instead of coding,it is now machine learning\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Instead of code running on CPU,it is now neural networks running on GPUs\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And neural networks, these neural networksthat are running on GPUs is now the formation of a new operating system, a new way of using computers\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The operating system of the moderncomputer, Large Language Models\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This machine learning approach has proven to be incredibly scalable\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  You can use it for all kinds of things\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Of course, digitized text, languages, of course, digitized sound,speech, images, video\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It could be multimodal\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  You could teach it amino acid sequences\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  You could teach it to understandjust about anything, anything where you have large observed data\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Well, that was the first step, was to understandthe meaning of the data\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Just by studying an enormousamount of text on the internet, we were able to understand the words, the vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and even the meaning of the words\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  by finding patterns and relationships\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Using the same approach, we're now able to not only understand the meaningof the different data types, connect it to different modalities—for example words and images\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Connect the image of the word 'cat' and the image of a catare now connected together, learning a multi-modality\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We can now even translate and generate, so we can understand data of all kinds, and we can generate intelligent information,intelligence of all kinds\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Well, if you look at all the amazing startupsthat are being created and the amazing applications that are being created,you can find it in this slide in one of the two combinations\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  One side to the other side, Text to text, would be summarization, question and answering, text generation, storytelling\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Video to text wouldbe captioning\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Image to text—image recognition\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Text to images— image generation like Midjourney\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Text to video—video creationlike Runway ML\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  All of these different combinationsare truly breakthrough\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  You can even have proteins to text, explain what a protein does\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Text to chemicals,describe properties of a chemical that might be a successful drugfor drug discovery\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  You can even have video and textto machine articulation, robotics\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Each one of these combinations is a new industry,new company, new application use case, incredible Cambrian explosionof the number of applications have now been created\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And we're just at the beginning\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  One of the properties of machine learning,of course, is that the larger the brain, the more data we can teach it, the smarter it becomes\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We call it the scaling law\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  There's every evidence that as we scale up the size of the models,the amount of training data, the effectiveness, the quality, the performanceof the intelligence improves\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Every single year, the industry is scaling upthe size of the models by 2X or so, which correspondingly need 2X the data, and therefore we need 4Xthe amount of compute\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The amount of computing resource necessaryto drive to the next level of artificial intelligenceis extraordinary\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We call that the scaling law, the training scaling law\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Pre-training is part of it, post-training is part of it\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Post-training with reinforcementlearning, human feedback, reinforcement learning, AI feedback\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  So many different ways now of using synthetic data generationin the post-training stage\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So training, pre-training,post-training is enjoying very significant scaling and we're continuingto see excellent results\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Well, when Strawberry orOpenAI’s o1 was announced, it exposed the worldto a new type of inference\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Inference is when you interact with the AI, just like ChatGPT\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  But ChatGPT is one shot\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  You ask it a question,you ask it to do something for you\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Whatever question you have, whatever prompts you provide, through one shot,it delivers an answer\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  However, we know that thinking is oftentimesmore than just one shot, and thinking requires us to maybe domulti-plans, multiple potential answersthat we choose the best one from\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Just like when we're thinking\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  We might reflect on the answerbefore we deliver the answer\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Reflection\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We might take a problem and break it down into step by stepby step, chain of thought\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  There are many different technologiesthat we've invented that makes it possible for inference to perform better and better as we apply more and more compute\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Now we have the second scaling law: inference scaling law\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Not just generation of the next word,but thinking, reflecting, planning\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  These two simultaneous scale lawsare going to require us to drive computing at extraordinary speeds\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Every single time when we deliver a new generation,a new architecture, we increase the performance by X factors, but we also decrease the powerby the same X factor\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  We decrease the cost by the same X factor\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  So driving up performance is exactlythe same as reducing cost\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Driving up the performance is exactlythe same as reducing energy\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  And so therefore as the world continuesto absorb and embrace artificial intelligence, it is our mission, it is our duty, it is our duty, to continue to drive theperformance up as fast as we can\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  In the process, expanding the reach of artificial intelligence,driving up its effectiveness, driving down its cost,driving down its power consumption\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  That's the reasonwhy we went to a one year cycle\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  However, AI is not a chip problem\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  These AI systems are enormous\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This is the Blackwell system\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Blackwell is the name of a GPU, but it'salso the name of this entire system\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The GPU is extraordinary in itself\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  There are two Blackwell dies\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Each Blackwell die is the largest chipthe world's ever made\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  104 billion transistors made by TSMC and their mostadvanced four nanometer node\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Two of these Blackwell dies are connected togetheracross 10TB/s, low energy link\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Right in the middle,right there, that line, that seam\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Thousands of interconnections between the two dies\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: Ten terabytes per second\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  It's connected by eight HBM3E memories from SK Hynixand from Micron\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And these memories togetherrun at 8 TB/s\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  And 8 TB/s, these two GPUs are connected to the CPU with another low, very low energy, very energy efficient series, 1 TB/s\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Each one of the GPUs are connectedthrough NVLink at 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 8 TB/s\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  That's a lot of terabytes per second\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And the reason for thatis because this system cannot work alone\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Even the most advanced computerthe world has ever made cannot work alonefor artificial intelligence\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Sometimes it has to work with thousandsof other computers like this, nodes like this, together as one computer,and sometimes they have to work separately because they are respondingto a different customer, different query\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  So sometimes separately,sometimes as one\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  In order to enable the GPUs to work as one,we of course have networking, two ConnectX-7s that connect this GPU with thousands of other GPUs, but we still need this NVLink\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This NVLink allows us to connect the few GPUs in one rackthat's standing behind me\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  That one rack behind me,that one rack is connected to, with this NVLink 5\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 0, 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 8TB per second, 35 times higher bandwidth than the highestbandwidth networking in the world, which allows us to connectall of these GPUs together to this NVLink switch\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  There are nine NVLink switches in one rack\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Each rack has 72 computers like this connected through this spine\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This is the NVLink spine\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This is cables, copper\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  50 pounds of copper, driven directly by this incredible series, incredible IO we call NVLink\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  They connect into, connect into the computer, into NVLink this way, and this switch connects all of these computers together as one\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And so what results, are 72 of these computers connected as one large GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  One incredibly large GPU\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  From the software perspective,it is just one giant chip, and these racks, these NVLinked 72 systems\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This one rack\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  This one rack is 3,000 pounds\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It is impossible to put on this stageotherwise I'd show it to you\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  That is 3,000 pounds and 120kW\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  That is, I have my my friends here\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  That's many, many Nintendo Switch power\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It is not portable but it's very powerful\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And so this is the Blackwell system\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  We designed this so that it can beconfigured as one superpod like this, or one entire gigantic data center with thousands and thousands of them,hopefully hundreds of thousands of them, And they're connected to themby the switches\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Some of them are Quantum InfiniBand switches\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  If you want to have a dedicated AI factoryor a Spectrum-X, NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionary ethernet system that you can integrate into your existing ethernet environments\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  We can build AI supercomputers with these, we can integrate them into enterprisedata centers, into hyperscalers, or configure them for the edge\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The Blackwell systemis not only incredibly powerful, it is also incredibly adaptable,so that it can fit into every corner of the world'scomputing infrastructure\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So this is this is Blackwell\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  On top of Blackwell,of course, is the computer\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  But most importantly,without all of the software that runs on top of it, this computer is justsimply impossible to operate\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  When you see these computerswith all of the liquid cooling, all of the wiring,the mind will blow up\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  How do you programsuch an incredible computer? This is where NVIDIA's software stack,this is where all of our effort in CUDA, NCCL, all of our Megatron, Megatron-Core, all of the software that we created,TensorRT LLM, Triton, all of the software that we created overthe years integrated into the system,makes it possible for everyone, anyone, to deployAI supercomputers around the world\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And then, of course, on top we have AI softwarethat makes it easy for people to build AI\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And so what is AI? What is AI? We talk about AIin a lot of different ways, but I think there are two types of AIsthat will be extremely popular\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  And there are two mental modelsthat I think are very helpful\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  It's very helpful to me\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  The first AI is basically a digital AI worker\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  These AI workers can understand, they can plan and they can take action\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Sometimes the digital AI workers are being asked to execute a marketing campaign, support a customer, come up with a manufacturing supplychain plan, optimize a chip, help us write software\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Maybe be a research assistant, a lab assistant in the drug discovery industry\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Maybe this agent you know is a tutor to the CEO\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Maybe there's a tutorfor all of our employees\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  These AI, these digital AI workers,we call them AI agents are essentially like digital employees\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And just like digital employees,you have to train them\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  You have to create datato welcome them to your company, teach them about your company\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  You train them for their particular skills, depending on what functionyou would like them to have, you evaluate themafter you're done training them to make sure that they learnedwhat they're supposed to learn, you guardrail themto make sure that they perform the job they're asked to do, and not the jobsthey're not asked to do\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  And of course, you operate them, you deploy them\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Provide them energy from Blackwell, the AI tokens from Blackwell\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And they interact with other agentsto work as a team to solve problems\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Well, you're goingto see all kinds of different agents\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  And we created several thingsto make it easier for the ecosystem to be ableto build AI agents for companies\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  NVIDIA is not in the service business\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  And we don't create, we don't deliverfinal product, we don't deliver solutions, but we do deliver the enabling technologyto make it possible for the ecosystem to create AI, to deliver AI, to continuously improve AI\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  The AI agent lifecycle libraries, the lifecycle platform is called NeMo, and NeMo has libraries for each one of the stages that I mentioned,from data curation to training, to fine tuning to synthetic data generationto evaluation, to guard railing\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And these libraries are integrated into workflowsand frameworks all over the world\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We're working with AI startups, service providerslike Accenture and Deloitte, companies all over the world to bring thisto all of the large companies\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  We also work with ISVs like ServiceNow so that they can create agentsthat use ServiceNow\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Today, you use ServiceNowby licensing the platform and your employees interact with the ServiceNow platformto get assistance\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  In the future, ServiceNow will also provide a large number of AI agentsthat you can rent\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Essentially digital employees that you canrent to help you solve problems\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  We're working with ServiceNow,we're working with SAP, Cadence, Ansys, companiesall over the world, Snowflake, companies all over the worldso that we can all build agents that can be helpful to youin driving productivity in your company\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Now, these agents are able to understand, reason, plan, take action\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And these agents are collections or systems of AI models\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  It's not just one AI model, but a system of AI models\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And NeMo helps us build those\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We also create pre-trained AI models that we package up inwhat is called a NIM\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  And so these NIMs are microservices\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  They're basically AI packaged\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  In the old days,software was packaged in a box and they'd come delivered with CD-ROMs\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Today, AI is packaged in a microservice andinside the software is smart\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  You could talk to the softwareand you could talk to the software because it understands what you mean,and you can connect the software with other software\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  You can connect thisAI with other AI, and together you could createessentially an agent, an AI agent\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So this is the first thing\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Let me give youan example of some of these agents\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  Agenetic AI is transforming every enterprise using sophisticatedreasoning and iterative planning to solve complex,multi-step problems\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  AI agents help marketing campaigns go live faster with instant insights,helping optimize supply chain operations, saving hundreds of millions in costs,and reduce software security processes from days to seconds by helping analyststriage vulnerabilities\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  What makes agenticAI so powerful is its ability to turn data into knowledge,and knowledge into action\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  A digital agent in this examplecan educate individuals with insights from a set of informationally

brains\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  The robots execute a task by perceivingtheir environment, reasoning, planning their next motion,and finally converting it to actions\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  These actions are simulated in the environmentby the World Simulator in Omniverse, and the results are perceived by the robot brainsthrough Omniverse sensor simulation\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  Based on the sensor simulations,the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and positionof everything in the factory digital twin\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  This software in the looptesting brings software defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments,letting industrial enterprises simulate and validate changesin an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world,saving massive risk and cost\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  The era of physical AI is here, transforming the world'sheavy

[Applause] mumai wow it's so great to be here Mumbai so much happening this is as you know India very very dear to the world's computer industry Central to the IT industry at the center at the core of the it of just about every single company in the world my industry your industry that we've built over the last several decades is going through fundamental change seismic change tectonic shifts let's talk about that today but before we start let me thank all of our partners our incredible partners that we're working with here in India to transform the IT industry together and so I'm delighted that all of you have joined us today there are two fundamental shifts that are happening at the same time this hasn't happened since 1964 the year after my birth it wasn't because of my birth but in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced the world to the concept of it the IT industry as we know it introduced the idea of general purpose Computing they described a central processing unit a CPU IO subsystems multitasking the separation of hardware and application software through a layer called the operating system IBM described family compatibility for application so that you could benefit by the install base of your Hardware to run your software over a long period of time they described architectural benefit across Generations so that the investment that you make in software the Investments you make in using the software is not squandered every single time you buy new hardware they recognized in 1964 the importance of in based the importance of software investment the importance of building computers that run the software architecture discipline all described in 1964 I've just described today's computer industry the same industry that the India IT industry was built from general purpose Computing as we know it has existed for 60 years until now for the last 30 years we've had the benefit of mors law an incredible phenomenon without changing the software the hardware can continue to improve in an architecturally compatible way and the benefits of that software doubles every year as a result of doubling in performance every year depending on what your applications you're reducing your cost by a factor of two every single year the most incredible depreciating force of any technology the world's ever known by depreciation cost reduction it made it possible for society to use more and more of it as we continue to consume it as we continue to process more data mors law made it possible for us to continue to drive down cost the critizing Computing as we know it today those two events the invention of the system 360 More's law with Windows PC drove what unquestionably one of the most important industries in the world every single industry has subsequently been built on top of it it but we know now that the scaling of CPUs has reached its limit we can't continue to ride that curve that that free Free Ride The Free Ride of Moors law has ended we have to now do something different or depreciation will end and we now will not enjoy depreciation but experience inflation Computing inflation and that's exactly what's happening around the world we no longer can afford to do nothing in software and expect that our computing experience will continue to improve that cost will decrease and continue to spread the benefits of it and to benefit from solving greater and greater challenges we started our company to accelerate software our vision was there are applications that would benefit from acceleration if we augmented general purpose Computing we take the workload that is very computer intensive and we offload it and we accelerate it using a model we call Cuda a programming model that we invented called cuda that made it possible for us to accelerate applications tremendously that acceleration benefit has the same qualities as mores law for applications that were impossible or impractical to perform using general purpose Computing we have the benefits of accelerated Computing to realize that capability for example computer Graphics real-time computer Graphics was made possible because of Nvidia coming into the world and make possible this new processor we call gpus the GPU was really the first accelerated Computing architecture running Cuda running computer Graphics a perfect example we democratized computer Graphics as we know it 3D Graphics is now literally everywhere it could be used as a medium for almost any application but we felt that longterm accelerated Computing could be far far more impactful and so over the last 30 years we've been on a journey to accelerate one domain of application after another the reason why this has taken so long is simply because of this there is no such magical processor that can accelerate everything in the world because if you could do that you would just call it a CPU you need to reinvent the Computing stack from the algorithms to the architecture underneath and connected to applications on top in one domain after another domain computer Graphics is a beginning but we've taken this architecture Cuda architecture from one industry after another industry after another industry today we accelerate so many important industries ktho is fundamental to semiconductor manufacturing computational lithography simulation computer Aid and Engineering even 5G radios that we've recently announced part Partnerships with that we can accelerate the 5G software stack Quantum Computing so that we can invent the future of computing with classical Quantum hybrid Computing parabricks are Gene sequencing software stack CVS one of the most important things every single company's working on is going from databases to knowledge bases so that we can create AI databases using qvs that we can create and vectorize all of your data qdf data frames data frames is essentially another word for structured data SQL acceleration is possible with qdf in each one of these different libraries we're able to accelerate the application 20 30 50 times of course it takes a rewrite of software which is the reason why it's taken so long in each one of these domains we've had to work with the industry work with our ecosystem software developers and customers in order to accelerate those applications for their domains kopt one of my favorites combinatorial Computing application a very uh Compu intensive application for example the travel salesperson problem every supply chain every driver Rider combination those applications could be accelerated with Coop incredible speed up modulus teaching and AI the laws of physics not just to be able to predict next word but to be able to predict the next moment in time of fluid dynamics and particle physics and so on so forth and of course one of the most famous application libraries we've ever created called cdnn made it possible to democratize artificial intelligence as we know it these acceleration libraries Now cover so many different domains that it appears that accelerated Computing is used everywhere but that's simply because we've applied this architecture one domain after another domain that we've covered just about every single industry now accelerated Computing or Cuda has reached the Tipping Point several years ago about a decade ago something very important happened and most of you have seen the same thing alexnet made a gigantic leap in the performance of computer vision computer vision is a very important field of artificial intelligence Alex net surprised the world with how much of a leap that it was able to produce we had the benefit of taking a step back and asking ourselves what are we witnessing why is alexnet so effective how far can it scale what else can we do with this approach called Deep learning and if we were to find ways to apply deep learning to other problems how does it affect the computer industry and if we wanted to do that if we believe in that future and we're excited about what deep learning can do how would we change every single layer of the Computing stack so that we could reinvent Computing all together 12 years ago we decided to dedicate our entire company to go pursue this Vision it is now 12 years later you every single time I've come to India I've had the benefit of talking to you about deep learning had benefit of talking to you about machine learning and I think it's very very clear now the world has completely changed now let's think about what happened the first thing that happened of course is how we do software our industry is underpinned by the method by which software is done the way that software was done call It software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 program rers would code algorithms we call functions into to run on a computer and we would apply it to input information to predict an output somebody would write python or C or Fortran or Pascal or C++ code algorithms that run on a computer you apply input to it and output is produced very classically the computer model that we understood quite well and it of course created one of the largest Industries in the world right here in India the production of software coding programming became a whole industry this all happened within our generation however that approach of developing software has been disrupted it is now not coding but machine learning using a computer using a computer to study the patterns and relationships of massive amounts of observed data to essentially learn from it the function that predicts it and so we are essentially designing a universal function approximator using machines to learn the expected output that would produce such a function and so going back and forth looking this is software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 with human coding to now software 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 using machine learning notice who is writing the software the software is now written by the computer and after you're done training the model you inference the model you then apply that function now as the input that function that large language model that deep learning model that computer vision model speech understanding model is now an input neural network that goes into the GPU that can now make a prediction given new input unobserved input this way of doing software notice is based on fundamentally machine learning and we have gone from coding to machine learning from developing software to creating artificial intelligence and from soft that prefers to run on CPUs to now neural networks that runs best on gpus this at its core is what happened to our industry in the last 10 years we have now seen the complete reinvention of the Computing stack the whole technology stack has been reinvented the hardware the way that software is able is is developed and what software can do is now fundamentally different we dedicated ourselves to advance this field and so this is what we now build what all of you have initially when I first met India we were building gpus that fit into a PCI Express card that goes into your PC this is what a GPU looks like today this is Blackwell incredible system that is designed to study data at an enormous scale yeah thank you a massive system designed to study data at an enormous scale so that we could discover patterns and relationships and learn the meaning of the data this is the Greek breakthrough in the last several years we have now learn the representation or the meaning of words and numbers and images and pixels and videos chemicals proteins amino acids fluid patterns particle physics we have now learned the meaning of so many different types of data we have learned to represent how to represent information in so many different modalities not only have we learned the meaning of it we can translate it to another modality so one great example of course is translating English to Hindi translating English large body of text into other English summarization from pixels to image image recognition from words to pixels image generation from images videos to words captioning from words to proteins used for drug discovery from words to chemicals discovering new compounds from amino acids to proteins understanding the structure of proteins these fundamental ideas essentially a universal translator of information from any modality to another modality has led to a Cambrian explosion of the number of startups in the world they're applying the basic method I just described if I could this and that what else can I do if I can do that and this what else can I do the number of applications has clearly exploded in the last couple two three years the number of generative AI companies around the world tens of thousands tens of billions of dollars have been invested in this field all because of this one instrument that made it possible for us to study data at enormous scales well I just want to say that that in order to build the black wall system of course the Blackwell GPU is involved but it takes seven other chips tsmc manufacture all of these chips and they're just doing an extraordinary job ramping the Blackwell system this is in a all in Blackwell is in full production and we're hoping to uh we're expecting to deliver in volume production in Q4 and so this is basically Blackwell now this is one of the things that's really incredible about about the system let me show it to you nothing's easy this morning this is MV link and it goes across the entire back spine of a rack of gpus and these gpus are all connected from the top to the bottom using MV link driving these incredible cies the world's longest driving CES for copper and it connects uh all of these gpus together 72 dual GPU packages of black WS 144 gpus connected together so it's one giant GPU if I were to spread out all of the chips to show you what this connects together it's essentially a GPU so large it' be like this big but it's obviously impossible to build gpus that large so we break it up into the L the smallest chunks we could which is retical limits and the most Advanced Technologies and we connect it together using MV link this is mvlink backs spine you're looking at all of the gpus being connected that's the quantum switch that connects all of these gpus together on top Spectrum X if you would like to have ethernet and uh what connects this together this is like 50 lbs this I'm just demonstrating how strong I am this is connected to this switch and this is one of the most advanced switches the world's ever built now all of this together represents Blackwell and then it runs the software uh that's on top the Cuda software CNN software uh Megatron for training the large language models tensor RT for doing the inference tensor RT llm for doing uh distributed multi-gpu inference for large language models and then on top of that we have two software Stacks one is NVIDIA AI Enterprise that I'll talk about in a second and then the other is Omniverse I'll talk about both of those in a second this job is surprisingly rigorous so this is the Blackwell system this is what Nvidia builds today those of you who have known us for very long time it's really quite surprising how the company has transformed but literally we reason from first principles how Computing was going to be done in the future and this is Blackwell now the Blackwell system the Blackwell system is extraordinary of course the computation is incredible each rack is 3,000 lb 120 kilowatt Watts 120,000 watts in each rack the density of computing the highest the world's ever known and what we're trying to do is to learn larger and smarter models it's called the scaling law the scaling law comes from the fact that the observation that the empirical observation and measurements that suggests the more data you have to train a large language model with and therefore to correspondingly large model size you know the more information you want to learn from the larger the model has to be or the larger model you would like to train the more data you need to have and each one each year we're increasing the amount of data and the model size each by about a factor of two which means that every single year the computation which is the product of those two has to increase by a factor of four now remember there was a time when the world Mo's law was two times every year and a half or 10 times every 5 years 100 times every 10 years we are now moving technology at a rate of four times every year four times every year over the course of 10 years incredible scaling and we continue to find that AI continues to get smarter as we scale up the uh uh the training size the second thing that we've discovered recently and this is a very big deal after you're done training the model of course uh all of you have used chat GPT when you use chat GPT is a oneshot you ask you give it a prompt instead of writing a program to Compu communicate with a computer today you write a prompt you just talk to the talk to the computer the way you talk to a person you describe the context you describe what it is you're you're querying about uh you could ask it to write a program for you you could you know ask it uh to write a recipe for you whatever question would like to have and the AI process through a very large neural network and produces a sequence of answers producing one one uh one word after another word in the future and starting with strawberry we realize that of course intelligence is not just one shot but intelligence requires thinking and thinking is reasoning and maybe you're doing path planning and maybe you're doing some simulations in your mind you're reflecting on your own answers and so as a result thinking results in higher quality answers and we've now discovered a second scaling law and this is a SCA scaling law at a time of inference the longer you think the higher quality answer you can produce this is not illogical this is very very intuitive to all of us if you were to ask me what's my favorite Indian food I would tell you chicken briani okay and I don't have to think about that very much and I don't have to reason about that I just know it and there are many things that you can ask it like for example what's Nvidia good at Nvidia is good at building AI supercomputers nvidia's uh great at building gpus and those are things that you know that it's encoded into your knowledge however there are many things that requires reasoning you know for example if I had to travel from uh Mumbai to California I I want to do it in the in a way that allows me to enjoy four other cities along the way you know today uh I got here at 3:00 a\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: m\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  this morning uh I got here through Denmark I I and right before Denmark I was in Orlando Florida and before Orlando Florida I was in California that was two days ago and I'm still trying to figure out what day we're in right now but anyways I'm happy to be here uh if I were to to tell it I would like to go from California uh to Mumbai uh I would like to do it within uh 3 days uh and I give it all kinds of constraints about what time I'm willing to leave and able to leave what hotels I like to stay at so on so forth uh the people I have to meet the number of permutations of that of course uh quite high and so the planning of that process coming up with a optimal plan is very very complicated and so that's where thinking reasoning planning comes in and the more you compute the higher quality answer uh you could provide and so we now have two fundamental scaling laws that is driving our technology development first for training and now for inference the number of foundation model makers has more than doubled since the beginning of Hopper there are more companies that realize that fundamental intelligence is vital to their company and that they have to build Foundation model technology and second the size of the models have increased by 20 30 40x the amount of computation necessary to train these model because of uh the size of the models but also multimodality capability um reinforcement learning capability synthetic data generation capability the amount of data that we use to train these models has really grown tremendously that's one and then the other reason of course is that Blackwell is also used for generating tokens at incredible speeds and so together all of these factors has led to the demand for Blackwell being incredibly High let's talk about now how we're going to use this technology the headline I thought was really good Nvidia is AI in India now aside from the letter V you could use Nvidia to create the rest of that sentence which I thought was really cool you don't know this story but in 1993 we had to come up with a name for our company and the reason why we chose Nvidia I'll do the extreme short version the reason why I chose Nvidia in the end was because I really love Nvidia being sounds like a mystical Place India Nvidia and sounded like a great place and so if it turns out that computer graphics and accelerated Computing didn't work out for us we could do almost anything and so I'm just happy it worked out okay so so Nvidia in India uh we have we have a really rich ecosystem here uh the first thing that you have to realize is that in order to build an AI ecosystem in any industry or in any country you have to start first with the ecosystem of the infrastructure and we announced that Yoda that ET T Communications and our other partners uh are joining us to build fundamental Computing infrastructure here in India and in just one year's time by the end of this year we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago that's the amount of infrastructure we're y so the first part of building an AI ecosystem is the AI infrastructure just as the first part of uh infrastructure for the internet ecosystem was building the infrastructure of of networking of course uh the infrastructure of networking internet consists of the personal computer cloud and and internet itself um in the case of AI it starts with the AI Computing infrastructure the next part the operating system of AI is large language models and we've worked with Partners here in India to build the Hindi large language model and Hindi large language model as you know there's 25 different um uh formal languages here in in India with apparently um a new a dialect every you know 1,500 kilometers and so so you don't have to go very far before you need to train another model this is the hardest language model region in the world and if anybody could do it you can do it and and once India figures out how to create the Hindi large language model you could you could figure it out for every other country so the next layer is um the application layer above that and uh uh working with us to bring uh AI to uh the ecosystem of India of course uh AI native companies that are creating new applications that are started that made possible only with AI and then our Service Partners uh from from wiipro to infosis to to TCS working with us to take the AI models and the AI infrastructure out to the world's Enterprises now that's Nvidia in India I'm going to have uh Vel our country leader come join me on stage because I would love for him to talk to you about some of the companies that we're working with here in India velle V to par okay so I'm going to intr a couple of other ideas and so earlier I told you that we have Blackwell we have all of the libraries acceleration libraries that we were talking about before but on top there are two very important platforms we working on one of them is called Nvidia AI Enterprise and the other is called Nvidia Omniverse and I'll explain each one of them very Qui quickly first Nvidia AI Enterprise this is a time now where the large language models and the fundamental AI capabilities have reached a level of capabilities were able to now create what is called agents large language models that understand understand the data that of course it's being presented it could be it could be streaming data could video data language model data it could be data of all kinds the first stage is perception the second is reasoning about given its observations uh what is the mission and what is the task it has to perform in order to perform that task the agent would break down the that task into steps of other tasks and uh it would reason about what it would take and it would connect with other AI models some of them are uh good at produ for example understanding PDF maybe it's a model that understands how to generate images maybe it's a model that uh uh is able to retrieve information AI information AI semantic data from a uh proprietary database so each one of these uh large language models models are connected to the central reasoning large language model we call agent and so these agents are able to perform all kinds of tasks uh some of them are maybe uh marketing agents some of them are customer service agents some of them are chip design agents Nvidia has Chip design agents all over our company helping us design chips maybe they're software engineering uh agents uh maybe uh uh maybe they're able to do marketing campaigns uh Supply Chain management and so we're going to have agents that are helping our employees become super employees these agents or agentic AI models uh augment all of our employees to supercharge them make them more productive now when you think about these agents it's really the way you would bring these agents into your company is not unlike the way you would onboard uh someone uh who's a new employee you have to give them training curriculum you have to uh fine-tune them teach them how to use uh how to perform the skills and understand the vocabulary of your of your company uh you evaluate them and so they evaluation systems and you might guardrail them if you're accounting agent uh don't do marketing if you're a marketing agent you know don't report earnings at the end of the quarter so on so forth and so each one of these agents are guardrail um that entire process we put into essentially an agent life cycle Suite of library and we call that Nemo our partners are working with us to integrate these libraries into their platforms so that they could enable agents to be created onboarded deployed improved into a life cycle of agents and so this is what we call Nvidia Nemo we have um on the one hand the libraries on the other hand what comes out of the output of it is a API inference microser service we call Nims essentially this is a factory that builds AIS and Nemo is a suite of libraries that on board and help you operate the AIS and ultimately your goal is to create a whole bunch of Agents we have Partners here that we're working with in India and Vel if you could tell everybody about our ecosystem here absolutely Jensen you know the word that stuck me as I was standing behind was was a word called Mystique this is the Mystique of India Jensen was here exactly 12 months back and he asked me a pretty profound question that the rich tapestry of India how are you going to encode it and it All Began from the infrastructure as mentioned in just 12 months today we have Computing from Yota which has built the stateof thee art y infrastructure tatas are going live E2 e2e has been in existence giving us exceled Computing infrastructure for a long long period of time all this Computing helped us to leave frog to solve one of India's largest problem that is about communication like Jensen said we speak in so many languages he did say 1500 kilm but all of you know every 5050 kilomet we change our dialect we don't only speak English we speak English and if you are from South there'll be a little bit of malali also added into it so how do we make this really work is the work of some of our partners Serum is a classical example serum basically started their efforts to basically help India talk they decided we're going to do voice to voice and and while doing voice to voice they had to understand how does this language work which is multimodal how do we make sure that it performs and they came into existence pretty quickly because there was infrastructure that was available to us similarly we saw projects coming from bhat GPT again a work that has been done predominantly in Academia the Academia in India has been rich with ideas and every time they wanted an idea to be translated into reality they need infrastructure today the work that we are doing in iits the work that we are doing at different organization is all a result of coming together solving the critical issue that India Has Not only was the language getting solved we also realized very quickly that there are many mega challenges that India has no one loves India more than Michelle a well spoken Indian and a healthy Indian always make a difference and that's why we have companies who've been working on health as many of us know it's been challenging how do we look after our health but Diagnostics coming from s Tuple cure\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  is really helping us solve many of these challenges so with that promise Jensen that's awesome healthy yeah and well spoken healthy and well spoken and the the important thing here that the uh it takes an entire ecosystem of Partners to be able to help the world apply AI to help their employees be more productive and this is whereas India was focused on it the back office operations of software the delivery of software producing software the next generation of it is going to be about producing and delivery of AI and as you know the delivery of software coding and the delivery of AI is fundamentally different but dramatically more impactful insanely more exciting and the ability for this industry for India to help every single company around the world to enjoy the benefit of Agents to enjoy the benefits of AIS across all of their different functionalities to be able to deploy it at scale I don't know anybody else who could do it this is just an extraordinary opportunity our job is to help you build Ai and deploy AI your job is to take these libraries and the capabilities that we have combine it with your incredible it capability software capabilities so that we can create agents and help every single company benefit from it and so this is the first part the second part is this what happens after agents now remember every single company has employees but most companies the goal is to build something to produce something to make something and that those things that people make could be factories it could be warehouses it could be cars and planes and trains and uh ship ships and so on and so forth all kinds of things computers and servers the servers that Nvidia builds it could be phones most companies in the largest of Industries ultimately produces something sometimes produce production of service which is the IT industry but many of your customers are about producing something those that next generation of AI needs to understand the physical world we call it physical AI in order to create physical AI we need three computers and we created three computers to do so the dgx computer which Blackwell for example is is a reference design an architecture for to create things like dgx computers for training the model that model needs a place to be refined it needs a place to learn it needs the place to apply its physical capability it's robotics capability we call that Omniverse a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics where robots can learn to be robots and then when you're done with the training of it that AI model could then run in the actual robotic system that robotic system could be a car it could be a robot it could be AV it could be a autonomous moving robot it could be a a picking arm uh it could be an entire Factory or an entire Warehouse that's robotic and that computer we call agx Jetson agx dgx for training and then Omniverse for doing the digital twin now here here in India we've got a really great ecosystem who is working with us to take this infrastructure take this ecosystem of capabilities to help the world build physical AI systems and you know what I've really loved is adorb is one of the largest robotics company they build Robotics and more importantly they put it in a digital twin where optimization takes place they teach the robo all the inputs that comes out of the physical world not only is that work taking place our system integrators asenta TCS Tech Mahindra are taking that knowledge not only into India but also outside India so do it in India for India and do from India for globe start locally grow globally right right that's fantastic okay thank you thank you thank you very much Michelle thank you thank you we made a short video to help you put everything together that I just said run it please for 60 years software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 0 code written by programmers ran on general purpose CPUs then software 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 arrived machine learning neural networks running on gpus this led to the Big Bang of generative AI models that learn and generate anything today generative AI is revolutionizing $100 trillion in Industries knowledge Enterprises use agentic AI to automate digital work hello I'm James a digital human Industrial Enterprises use physical AI to automate physical work physical AI embodies robots like self-driving cars that safely navigate the real world manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks and humanoid robots who work collaboratively alongside us plants and factories will be embodied by physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operations or speaking to us Nvidia builds three computers to enable developers to create physical AI the models are first trained on dgx then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcement learning physics feedback in Omniverse and the trained AI runs on Nvidia Jetson agx robotics computers Nvidia Omniverse is a physics-based operating system for physical AI simulation robots learn and fine-tune their skills in Isaac lab a robot gym built on Omniverse this is just one robot future factories will orchestrate teams of robots and monitor entire operations through thousands of sensors for factory digital digal twins they use an Omniverse blueprint called Mega with mega the factory digital twin is populated with virtual robots and their AI models the robots brains the robots execute a task by perceiving their environment reasoning planning their next motion and finally converting it to actions these actions are simulated in the environment by the world simulator in Omniverse and the results are perceived by the robot brains through Omniverse sensor simulation based on the sensor simulations the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and position of everything in the factory digital twin this software in the loop testing brings softwar defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments letting Industrial Enterprises simulate and validate changes in an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world saving massive risk and cost the era of physical AI is here transforming the world's heavy Industries and Robotics [Music]

flow in such your compelling story I'm super nervous about this just got to get in the Rhythm we're 2 weeks away from you guys can go really really make it bre we should take a swing at it yeah that's the plan we need to get daily status on that animation can you mute cuz I hear myself sorry what's the drop date for all the videos it needs to be done on the 28th did you get all that safe travels everybody super excited to see everyone see you guys soon okay bye we're basically moving as fast as the world can absorb technology so we've got to LEAP from ourselves [Music] in now the spine you just have to figure out a way to make it pop you know what I'm [Music] saying you know what I'm saying you want to yeah that kind of thing [Music] okay thank you I'm super late let's [Music] go please welcome welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Music] W I am very happy to be back thank you NTU for letting us use your Stadium the last time I was here I received a degree from [Applause] n and I gave the Run don't walk speech and today we have a lot to cover so I cannot walk I must run we have a lot to cover I have many things to tell you I'm very happy to be here in Taiwan Taiwan is the home of our treasured Partners this is in fact where everything Nvidia does begins our partners and ourselves take it to the world Taiwan and our partnership has created the world's AI infrastructure today I want to talk to you about several things one what is happening and the meaning of the work that we do together what is generative AI what is its impact on our industry and on every industry a blueprint for how we will go forward and engage this incredible opportunity and what's coming next generative Ai and its impact our blueprint and what comes next these are really really exciting times a restart of our computer industry an industry that you have forged an IND industry that you have created and now you're prepared for the next major Journey but before we start Nvidia lives at the intersection of computer graphics simulations and artificial intelligence this is our soul everything that I show you today is simulation it's math it's science it's computer science it's amazing computer architecture none of it's animated and it's all homemade this is invidious soul and we put it all into this virtual world we called Omniverse please enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] when doubt [Applause] I want to speak to you in Chinese but I have so much to tell you I have to think too hard to speak Chinese so I have to speak to you in English at the foundation of everything that you saw was two fundamental Technologies accelerated Computing and artificial intelligence running inside the Omniverse those two technologies those two fundamental forces of computing are going to reshape the computer industry the computer industry is now some 60 years old in a lot of ways everything that we do today was invented the year after my birth in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced central processing units general purpose Computing the separation of hardware and software through an operating system multitasking IO subsystems dma all kinds of technologies that we use today architectural compatibility backwards compa ibility family compatibility all of the things that we know today about Computing largely described in 1964 of course the PC Revolution democratized Computing and put it in the hands and the houses of everybody and then off in 2007 the iPhone introduced mobile Computing and put the computer in our pocket ever since everything is connected and running all the time through the mobile cloud this last 60 years we saw several just several not that many actually two or three major technology shifts two or three tectonic shifts in Computing where everything changed and we're about to see that happen again there are two fundamental things that are happening the first is that the processor the engine by which the computer industry runs on the central processing unit the performance scaling has slowed tremendously and yet the amount of computation we have to do is still doubling very quickly exponentially if processing requirement if the data that is that we need to process continues to scale exponentially but performance does not we will experience computation inflation and in fact we're seeing that right now as we speak the amount of data center power that's used all over the world is growing quite substantially the cost of computing is growing we are seeing computation inflation this of course cannot continue the data is going to continue to increase exponentially and CPU performance scaling will never return there is a better way for almost two decades now we've been working on accelerated Computing Cuda augments a CPU offloads and accelerates the work that A specialized processor can do much much better in fact the performance is so extraordinary that it is very clear now as CPU scaling has slowed and event substantially stopped we should accelerate everything I predict that every application that is processing intensive will be accelerated and surely every data center will be accelerated the near future now accelerated Computing is very sensible it's very common sense if you take a look at an application and here the 100t means 100 units of time it could be 100 seconds it could be 100 hours and in many cases as you know we're now working on artificial intelligence applications that run for a 100 days the ont is code that is requires sequential processing where single-threaded CPUs are really quite essential operating systems control logic really essential to have one instruction executed after another instruction however there are many algorithms computer Graphics is one that you can operate completely in parallel computer Graphics image processing physics simulations combinatorial optimizations graph processing database processing and of course the very famous linear algebra of deep learning there are many types of algorithms that are very conducive to acceleration through parallel processing so we invented an architecture to to do that by adding the GPU to the CPU the specialized processor can take something that takes a great deal of time and accelerate it down to something that is in incredibly fast and because the two processors can work side by side they're both autonomous and they're both separate independent that is we could accelerate what used to take a 100 units of time down to one unit of time well the speed up is incredible it almost sounds unbelievable it almost sounds unbelievable but today I'll demonstrate many examples for you the benefit is quite extraordinary a 100 times speed up but you only increase the power by about a factor of three and you increase the cost by only about 50% we do this all the time in the PC industry we add a GPU a $500 GPU gForce GPU to a $1,000 PC and the performance increases tremendously we do this in a data center a billion dooll data center we add $500 million worth of gpus and all of a sudden it becomes an AI Factory this is happening all over the world today well the savings are quite extraordinary you're getting 60 times performance per dollar a 100 times speed up you only increase your power by 3x 100 times speed up you only increase inre your cost by 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 5x the savings are incredible the savings are measured in dollars it is very clear that many many companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars processing data in the cloud if it was accelerated it is not unexpected that you could save hundreds of millions of dollars now why is that well the reason for that is very clear we've been experiencing inflation for so long in general purpose Computing now that we finally came to we finally determined to accelerate there's an enormous amount of captured loss that we can now regain a great deal of captured retained waste that we can now relieve out of the system and that will translate into savings Savings in money Savings in energy and that's the reason why you've heard me say the more you buy the more you save and now I've shown you the mathematics it is not accurate but it is correct okay that's called CEO math CEO math is not accurate but it is correct the more you buy the more you save well accelerated computing does deliver extraordinary results but it is not easy why is it that it saves so much money but people haven't done it for so long the reason for that is because it's incredibly hard there is no such thing as a software that you can just run through a c compiler and all of a sudden that application runs a 100 times faster that is not even logical if it was possible to do that they would have just changed the CPU to do that you in fact have to rewrite the software that's the hard part the software has to be completely Rewritten so that you could reactor reexpress the algorithms that was written on a CPU so that it could be accelerated offloaded accelerated and run in parallel that computer science exercise is insanely hard well we've made it easy for the world over the last 20 years of course the very famous cdnn the Deep learning library that processes neural networks we have a library for AI physics that you could use for fluid dynamics and many other applications where the neural network has to obey the laws of physics we have a great new library called aerial that is a Cuda accelerated 5G radio so that we can software Define and accelerate the Telecommunications networks the way that we've soft software defined the world world's networking um uh internet and so the ability for us to accelerate that allows us to turn all of Telecom into essentially the same type of platform a Computing platform just like we have in the cloud kitho is a comp computational lithography platform that allows us to uh process the most computationally intensive parts of Chip manufacturing making the mask tsmc is in the process of going to production with k litho saving enormous amounts of energy and more enormous amounts of money but the goal for tsmc is to accelerate their stack so that they're prepared for even further advances in algorithm and more computation for deeper and deeper uh narrow and narrow transistors parab brakes is our Gene sequencing Library it is the highest throughput library in the world for Gene sequencing coopt is an incredible library for combinatorial optimization route planning optimization the traveling salesman problem incredibly complicated people do people have well scientists have largely concluded that you needed a quantum computer to do that we created an algorithm that runs on accelerated Computing that runs Lightning Fast 23 World Records we hold every single major world record today C Quantum is an emulation system for a quantum computer if you want to design a quantum computer comp you need a simulator to do so if you want to design Quantum algorithms you need a Quantum emulator to do so how would you do that how would you design these quantum computers create these Quantum algorithms if the quantum computer doesn't exist while you use the fastest computer in the world that exist today and we call it of course Nvidia Cuda and on that we have an emulator that simulates quantum computers it is used by several hundred thousand researchers around the world it is integrated into all the leading M leading Frameworks for Quantum Computing and is used in scientific super super Computing centers all over the world kdf is an unbelievable library for data processing data processing consumes the vast majority of cloud spend today all of it should be accelerated qdf accelerates the major libraries used in the world spark many of you probably use spark in your companies pandas um a new one called polar and of course uh networkx which is a graph processing graph processing uh database um library and so these are just some examples there are so many more each one of them had to be created so that we can enable the ecosystem to take advantage of accelerated Computing if we hadn't created cudnn Cuda alone wouldn't have been able wouldn't have been possible for of the deep learning scientists around the world to use because Cuda and the algorithms that are used in tensor flow and Pi torch the Deep learning algorithms the separation is too far apart it's almost like trying to do computer Graphics without open G it's almost like doing data processing without SQL these domain specific libraries are really The Treasure of our company we have 350 of them the these libraries Is What It Takes and what has made it possible for us to have such open so many markets I'll show you some other examples today well just last week Google announced that theyve put CDF in the cloud and accelerate pandas pandas is the most popular data science library in the world many of you in here probably already use pandas it's used by 10 million data scientists in the world downloaded 170 million times each month it is the Excel that is the spreadsheet of data scientists well with just one click you can now use pandas in C collab which is Google's cloud data centers platform accelerated by CDF the speed up is really incredible let's take a look [Music] that was a great demo right didn't take [Applause] long when you accelerate data processing that fast demos don't take long okay well Cuda has now achieved what people call a Tipping Point but it's even better than that Cuda has now achieved a virtuous cycle this rarely happens if you look at history and all the Computing architecture Computing Platforms in the case of microprocessor CPUs it has been here for 60 years it has not been changed for 60 years at this level this way of doing Computing accelerated Computing has been around has creating a new platform is extremely hard because it's a chicken and egg problem if there are no developers that use your platform then of course there will be no users but if there are no users there are no install base if they're no install base developers aren't interested in it developers want to write software for a large install base but a large install base requires a lot of applications so that users would create that install base this chicken or the egg problem has rarely been broken and has taken us now 20 years one domain Library after another one acceleration Library another and now we have 5 million developers around the world we serve every single industry from Health Care Financial Services of course the computer industry automotive industry just about every major industry in the world just about every field of science because there are so many customers for our architecture oems and cloud service providers are interested in building our systems system makers am amazing system makers like the ones here in Taiwan are interested in building our systems which then takes and offers more systems to the market which of course creates greater opportunity for us which allows us to increase our scale R&D scale which speeds up the application even more well every single time we speed up the application the cost of computing goes down this is that slide I was showing you earlier 100x speed up translates to 97 96% 98% savings and so when we go from 100x speed up to 200x speed up to a000 X speed up the savings the marginal cost of computing continues to fall well of course we believe that by reducing the cost of computing incredibly the market developers scientists inventors will continue to discover new algorithms that cons consume more and more and more Computing so that one day something happens that a pH shift happens that the marginal cost of computing is so low that a new way of using computers emerge in fact that's what we're seeing now over the years we have driven down the marginal cost of computing in the last 10 years in one particular algorithm by a million times well as a result it is now very logical and very common sense to train large language models with all of the data on the internet nobody thinks twice this idea that you could create a computer that could process so much data to write its own software the emergence of artificial intelligence was made possible because of this complete belief that if we made Computing cheaper and cheaper and cheaper somebody's going to find a great use well today Cuda has achieved the virtual cycle install base is growing Computing cost is coming down which causes more developers to come up with more ideas which drives more demand and now we're on in the beginning of something very very important but before I show you that I want to show you what is not possible if not for the fact that we created Cuda that we created the modern version of General the modern Big Bang of AI generative AI what I'm about to show you would not be possible this is Earth two the idea that we would create a digital twin of the earth that we would go and simulate the Earth so that we could predict the future of our planet to better Aver disasters or better understand the impact of climate change so that we can adapt better so that we could change our habits now this digital twin of Earth is probably one of the most ambitious projects that the world's ever undertaken and we're taking step large steps every single year and I'll show you results every single year but this year we made some great breakthroughs let's take a look on Monday the storm will Veer North again and approach Taiwan there are big uncertainties regarding its path different paths will have different levels of impact on Taiwan forvia Earth [Music] [Music] 2f [Music] for fore cordi AI [Music] Nvidia [Music] [Music] [Applause] someday in the near future we will have continuous weather prediction at every at every Square kilometer on the planet you will always know what the climate's going to be you will always know and this will run continuously because we trained the AI and the AI requires so little energy and so this is just an incredible achievement I hope you you enjoyed it and very importantly uh what [Applause] the truth is that was a Jensen AI that was not me I I wrote I wrote it but an AI Jens AI had to say it because of our dedication to continuously improve the performance of Drive the cost down researchers discover discovered AI researchers discovered Cuda in 2012 that was nvidia's first contact with AI this was a very important day we had the good wisdom to work with the the scientists to make it possible for a deep learning to happen and Alex net achieved of course a tremendous computer vision breakthrough but the great wisdom was to take a step back and understanding what was the background what is the foundation of deep learning what is its long-term impact what is its potential and we realized that this technology has great potential to scale an algorithm that was invented and discovered decades ago all of a sudden because of more data larger networks and very importantly a lot more compute all of a sudden deep learning was able to achieve what no human algorithm was able to now imagine if we were to scale up the architecture even more larger networks more data and more compute what could be possible so we dedicated ourselves to reinvent everything after 2012 we changed the architecture of our GPU to add tensor course we invented MV link that was 10 years ago now CNN tensor RT nickel we bought melanox tensor RT LM the Triton inference server and all of it came together on a brand new computer nobody understood nobody asked for it nobody understood it and in fact I was certain nobody wanted to buy it and so we announced it at GTC and open AI a small company in San Francisco saw it and they asked me to deliver one to them I delivered the first dgx the F the world's first AI supercomputer to open AI in 2016 well after that we continued to scale from one AI supercomputer one AI Appliance we scaled it up to large supercomputers even larger by 2017 the world discovered Transformers so that we could train enormous amounts of data and recognize and learn patterns that are sequential over large spans of time it is now possible for for us to train these large language models to understand and achieve a breakthrough in natural language understanding and we kept going after that we built even larger ones and then in November 2022 trained on thousands tens of thousands of Nvidia gpus in a very large AI supercomputer open AI announced chat GPT 1 million users after five days 1 million after five days a 100 million after two months the fastest growing application in history and the reason for that is very simple it is just so easy to use and it was so magical to use to be able to interact with computer like it's Human Instead of being clear about what you want it's like the computer understands your meaning it understands your intention oh I think here it it um asked the the closest Night Market night as you know U the night market is very important to me so when I was young uh I was I think I was four and a half years old I used to love going to the night mark Market because I I just love watching people and and uh uh and so we went my parents used to take us to the night market uh and and um uh and I love I love U I love going and one day uh my face you guys might might see that I have a large scar on my face my face was cut because somebody was washing their knife and I was a little kid um but my memories of of the Night Market is uh so deep because of that and I used to love I I just I still love going to the night market and I just need to tell you guys this the the Tona Night Market is is really good because there's a lady uh she's been working there for 43 years she's the fruit lady and it's in the middle of the stre the middle between the two go find her okay she [Applause] she's really terrific I think it would be funny after this all of you go to see her she every year she's doing better and better her cart has improved and yeah I just love watching her succeed anyways anyways uh Chad GPT came along and um and something is very important in this slide here let me show you something this slide okay and this Slide the fundamental difference is this until chat GPT revealed it to the world AI was all about perception natural language understanding Compu computer vision speech recognition it's all about perception and detection this was the first time the world saw a generative AI It produced tokens one token at a time and those tokens were words some of the tokens of course could now be images or charts or tables songs words speech videos those tokens could be anything they anything that that you can learn the meaning of it could be tokens of chemicals tokens of proteins genes you saw earlier in Earth 2 we were generating tokens of the weather we can we can learn physics if you can learn physics you could teach an AI model physics the AI model could learn the meaning of physics and it can generate physics we were scaling down to 1 kilometer not by using filtering it was generating and so we can use this method to generate tokens for almost anything almost anything of value we can generate steering wheel control for a car we can generate articulation for a robotic arm everything that we can learn we can now generate we have now arrived not at the AI era but a generative AI era but what's really important is this this computer that started out as a supercomputer has now evolved into a Data Center and it produces one thing it produces tokens it's an AI Factory this AI Factory is generating creating producing something of Great Value a new commodity in the late 1890s Nicola Tesla invented an AC generator we invented an AI generator the AC generator generated electrons nvidia's AI generator generates tokens both of these things have large Market opportunities it's completely fungible in almost every industry and that's why it's a new Industrial Revolution we have now a new Factory producing a new commodity for every industry that is of extraordinary value and the methodology for doing this is quite scalable and the methodology of doing this is quite repeatable notice how quickly so many different AI models generative AI models are being invented literally daily every single industry is now piling on for the very first time the IT industry which is $3 trillion $3 trillion IT industry is about to create something that can directly serve a hundred trillion dollar of Industry no longer just an instrument for information storage or data processing but a factory for generating intelligence for every industry this is going to be a manufacturing industry not a manufacturing industry of computers but using the computers in manufacturing this has never happened before quite an extraordinary thing what led started with accelerated comp Computing led to AI led to generative Ai and now an industrial revolution now the impact to our industry is also quite significant of course we could create a new commodity a new product we call tokens for many Industries but the impact of ours is also quite profound for the very first time as I was saying earlier in 60 years every single layer of computing has been changed from CPUs general purpose Computing to accelerated GPU Computing where the computer needs instructions now computers process llms large language models AI models and whereas the Computing model of the past is retrieval based almost every time you touch your phone some pre-recorded text or pre-recorded image or pre-recorded video is retrieved for you and recomposed based on a recommender system to present it to you based on your habits but in the future your computer will generate as much as possible retrieve only what's necessary and the reason for that is because generated generated data requires less energy to go fetch information generated data also is more contextually relevant it will encode knowledge it will your understanding of you and instead of get that inform information for me or get that file for me you just say ask me for an answer and instead of a tool instead of your computer being a tool that we use the computer will now generate skills it performs tasks and instead of an industry that is producing software was which was a revolu evolutionary idea in the early 90s remember the idea that Microsoft created for packaging software revolutionize the PC industry without packaged software what would we use the PC to do it drove this industry and now we have a new Factory a new computer and what we will run on top of this is a new type of software and we call it Nims Nvidia inference microservices now what what happens is the Nim runs inside this Factory and this Nim is a pre-trained model it's an AI well this AI is of course quite complex in itself but the the Computing stack that runs AIS are insanely complex when you go and use chat GPT underneath their stack is a whole bunch of software underneath that prompt is a ton of software and it's incredibly complex because the models are large billions to trillions of parameters it doesn't run on just one computer it runs on multiple computers it has to distribute the workload across multiple gpus tensor parallelism pipeline parallelism data parallel all kinds of parallelism expert parallelism all kinds of parallelism Distributing the workload across multiple gpus processing it as fast as possible because if you are in a factory if you run a factory your throughput directly correlates to your revenues your throughput directly correlates to quality of service and your throughput directly correlates to number of people who can use your service we are now in a world where data center throughput utilization is vitally important it was important in the past but not Vally important it was important in the past but people don't measure it today every par parameter is measured start time uptime utilization throughput idle time you name it because it's a factory when something is a factory its operations directly correlate to the financial performance of the company and so we realized that this is incredibly complex for most companies to do so what we did was we created this AI in a box and it containers an incredible amounts of software inside this container is Cuda cudnn tensor RT Triton for inference Services it is cloud native so that you could Auto scale in a kubernetes environment it has Management Services and hooks so that you can monitor your AIS it has common apis standard apis so that you could literally chat with this box you download this Nim and you can talk to it so long as you have Cuda on your computer which is now of course everywhere it's in every cloud available from every computer maker it is available in hundreds of millions of PCS when you download this you have an AI and you can chat with it like chat GPT all of the software is now integrated 400 dependencies all integrated into one we tested this Nim each one of these pre-trained models against all kind are Tire install base that's in the cloud all the different versions of Pascal and ampers and Hoppers and all kinds of different versions I even forget some Nims incredible invention this is one of my favorites and of course as you know we now have the ability to create large language models and pre-trained models of all kinds and we we have all of these various versions whether it's language based or Vision based or Imaging based or we have versions that are available for healthc care digital biology we have versions that are digital humans that I'll talk to you about and the way you use this just come to ai\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  nvidia\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: com and today we uh just posted up in hugging face the Llama 3 Nim fully optimized it's available there for you to try and you can even take it with you it's available to you for free and so you could run it in the cloud run it in any Cloud you could download this container put it into your own Data Center and you could host it make it available for your customers we have as I mentioned all kinds of different domains physics some of it is for semantic retrieval called Rags Vision languages all kinds of different languages and the way that you use it is connecting these microservices into large applications one of the most important applications in the coming future of course is customer service agents customer service agents are necessary in just about every single industry it represents trillions of dollars of of customer service around the world nurses are customer service agents um in some ways some of them are nonprescription or or non Diagnostics um based nurses are essentially customer service uh customer service for retail for uh Quick Service Foods Financial Services Insurance just tens and tens of millions of customer service can now be augmented by language models and augumented by Ai and so these one these boxes that you see are basically Nims some of the NIMS are reasoning agents given a task figure out what the miss is break it down into a plan some of the NIMS retrieve information some of the NIMS might uh uh uh go and do search some of the NIMS uh might use a tool like kuop that I was talking about earlier they could use a tool that uh could be running on sap and so it has to learn a particular uh language called abap maybe some Nims have to uh uh do SQL queries and so all of these Nims are experts that are now assembled as a team so what's happening the application layer has been changed what used to be applications written with instructions are now applications that are assembling teams assembling teams of AIS very few people know how to write programs almost everybody knows how to break down a problem and assemble teams very every company I believe in the future will have a large collection of Nims and you would bring down the experts that you want you connect them into a team and you you don't even have to figure out exactly how to connect them you just give the mission to an agent to a Nim to figure out who to break the task down and who to give it to and they that a that Central the leader of the of the application if you will the leader of the team would break down the task and give it to the various team members the team members would do their perform their task bring it back to the team leader the team leader would reason about that and present an information back to you just like humans this is in our near future this is the way applications are going to look now of course we could interact with these large these AI services with text prompts and speech prompts however there are many applications where we would like to interact with what what is otherwise a humanlike form we call them digital humans Nvidia has been working on digital human technology for some time let me show it to you and well before I do that hang on a second before I do that okay digital humans has the potential of being a great interact Interactive with you they make much more engaging they could be much more empathetic and of course um we have to uh uh cross this incredible Chasm this uncanny Chasm of realism so that the digital humans would appear much more natural this is of course our vision this is a vision of where we love to go uh but let me show you where we are great to be in Taiwan before I head out to the night market let's dive into some exciting frontiers of digital humans imagine a future where computers interact with us just like humans can hi my name is Sophie and I am a digital human brand ambassador for Unique this is the incredible reality of digital humans digital humans will revolutionize industries from customer service to advertising and ging the possibilities for digital humans are endless using the scans you took of your current kitchen with your phone they will be AI interior designers helping generate beautiful photorealistic suggestions and sourcing the materials and Furniture we have generated several design options for you to choose from they'll also be AI customer service agents making the interaction more engaging and personalized or digital healthcare workers who will check on patients providing Timely personalized care um I did forget to mention to the doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications the antibiotics you've been prescribed cicin and metronidazol don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them and they'll even be AI brand ambassadors setting the next marketing and advertising Trends hi I'm EMA Japan's first virtual model new breakthroughs in generative Ai and computer Graphics let digital humans see understand and interact with us in humanlike ways H from what I can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup the foundation of digital humans are AI models built on multilingual speech recognition and synthesis and llms that understand and generate conversation the AIS connect to another generative AI to dynamically animate a lifelike 3D mesh of a face and finally AI models that reproduce lifelike appearances enabling real-time path traced subsurface scattering to simulate the way light penetrates the skin scatters and exits at various points giving skin its soft and translucent appearance Nvidia Ace is a suite of digital human Technologies packaged as easy to deploy fully optimized microservices or Nims developers can integrate Ace Nims into their existing Frameworks engines and digital human experiences neotron slm and llm Nims to understand our intent and orchestrate other models Reva speech Nims for interactive speech and translation audio to face and gesture Nims for facial and body animation an Omniverse RTX with dlss for neuro rendering of skin and hair Ace Nims run on Nvidia gdn a Global Network of Nvidia accelerated infrastructure that delivers low latency digital human processing to over 100 regions Kaa [Applause] pretty incredible well those those Ace runs in a cloud but it also runs on PCS we had the good wisdom of including tensor core gpus in all of RTX so we've been shipping AI gpus for some time preparing ourselves for this day the reason for that is very simple we always knew that in order to create a new Computing platform you need to install Bas first eventually the application will come if you don't create the install base how could the application come and so if you build it they might not come but if you build it if you don't build it they cannot come and so we installed every single RTX GPU with tensor core G tensor core processing and now we have 100 million GeForce RTX AIP PCS in the world and we're shipping 200 and this this compy Tex wor featuring four new amazing laptops all of them are able to run AI your future laptop your future PC will become an AI it'll be constantly helping you assisting you in the background the PC will also run applications that are enhanced by AI of course all your photo editing and your writing and your tools all the things that you use will all be enhanced by Ai and your PC will also host applications with digital humans that are AIS and so there are different ways that AIS will manifest themselves and become used in PCS but PCS will become very important AI platform and so where do we go from here I spoke earlier about the scaling of our data centers and every single time we scaled we found a new phase change when we scaled from dgx into large AI supercomputers we enabled Transformers to be able to train on enormously large data data sets well what happened was in the beginning the data was human supervised it required human labeling to train AIS unfortunately there is only so much you can human label Transformers made it possible for unsupervised learning to happen now Transformers just look at an enormous amount of data or look at enormous amount of video or look at enormous amount of uh images and it can learn from studying an enormous amount of data find the patterns and relationships itself while the next generation of AI needs to be physically based most of the AIS today uh don't understand the laws of physics it's not grounded in the physical world in order for us to generate uh uh images and videos and 3D graphics and many physics phenomenons we need AIS that are physically based and understand the laws of physics well the way that you could do that is of course learning from video is One Source another way is synthetic data simulation data and another way is using computers to learn with each other this is really no different than using alphao having alphao play itself selfplay and between the two capabilities same capabilities playing each other for a very long period of time they emerge even smarter and so you're going to start to see this type of AI emerging well if the AI data is synthetically generated and using reinforcement learning it stands to reason that the rate of data generation will continue to advance and every single time data generation grows the amount of computation that we have to offer needs to grow with it we are about to enter a phase where AIS can learn the laws of physics and understand and be grounded in physical world data and so we expect that models will continue to grow and we need larger gpus well Blackwell was designed for this generation this is Blackwell and has several very important Technologies uh one of course is just the size of the chip we took two of the largest a chip that is as large as you can make it at tsmc and we connected two of them together with a 10 terabytes per second link between the world's most advanced cies connecting these two together we then put two of them on a computer node connected with a gray CPU the gray CPU could be used for several things in the training situation it could use it could be used for fast checkpoint and restart in the case of inference and generation could be used for storing context memory so that the AI has memory and understands uh the context of the the conversation you would like to have it's our second generation Transformer engine Transformer engine allows us to adapt dynamically to a lower precision based on the Precision and the range necessary for that layer of computation uh this is our second generation GPU that has secure AI so that you could you could ask your service provider to protect your AI from being either stolen from theft or tampering this is our fifth generation MV link MV link allows us to connect multiple gpus together and I'll show you more of that in a second and this is also our first generation with a reliability and availability engine this system this Ras system allows us to test every single transistor flip-flop memory on chip memory off chip so that we can in the field determine whether a particular chip is uh failing the mtbf the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 10,000 gpus is a measured in hours the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 100,000 gpus is measured in minutes and so the ability for a supercomputer to run for a long period of time and train a model that could last for several months is practically impossible if we don't invent Technologies to enhance its reliability reliability would of course enhance its uptime which directly affects the cost and then lastly decompression engine data processing is one of the most important things we have to do we added a data compression engine decompression engine so that we can pull data out of storage 20 times faster than what's possible today well all of this repres presents Blackwell and I think we have one here that's in production during GTC I showed you Blackwell in a prototype State um the other side this is why we practice [Laughter] ladies and gentlemen this is Blackwell black Blackwell is in production incredible amounts of Technology this is our production board this is the most complex highest performance computer the world's ever made this is the great CPU and these are you could see each one of these blackw dieses two of them connected together you see that it is the largest die the largest chip the world makes and then we connect two of them together with a 10 terabyte per second link okay and that makes the Blackwell computer and the performance is incredible take a look at this so um you see you see our uh the the computational the flops the AI flops uh for each generation has increased by a thousand times in eight years Mo's law in eight years is something along the lines of oh I don't know maybe 40 60 and in the last eight years Moors law has gone a lot lot less and so just to compare even Moors law at its best of times compared to what Blackwell could do so the amount of computations is incredible and when whenever we bring the computation High the thing that happens is the cost goes down and I'll show you what we've done is we've increased through its computational capability the energy used to train a gp4 2 trillion parameter 8 trillion Tokens The amount of energy that is used has gone down by 350 times Well Pascal would have taken 1,000 gwatt hours 1,000 gwatt hours means that it would take a gigawatt data center the world doesn't have a gigawatt data center but if you had a gigawatt data center it would take a month if you had 100 watt 100 megawatt data center it would take about a year and so nobody would of course um uh create such a thing and um and that's the reason why these large language models chat GPT was impossible only eight years ago by us driving down the increasing the performance the energy efficent while keeping and improving energy efficent efficiency along the way we've now taken with Blackwell what used to be 1,000 gwatt hours to three an incredible Advance uh 3 gwatt hours if it's a if it's a um uh uh a 10,000 gpus for example it would only take a coule 10,000 gpus I guess it would take a few days 10 days or so so the amount of advance in just eight years is incredible well this is for inference this is for token generation Our token generation performance has made it possible for us to drive the energy down by three 45,000 times 177,000 Jewels per token that was Pascal 177,000 Jewels it's kind of like two light bulbs running for two days it would take two light bulbs running for two days amounts of energy 200 Watts running for two days to generate one token of gp4 it takes about three tokens to generate one word and so the amount of energy used necessary for Pascal to generate gp4 and have a chat GPT experience with you was practically impossible but now we only use 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 4 Jew per token and we can generate tokens at incredible rates and very little energy okay so Blackwell is just an enormous lead well even so it's not big enough and so we have to build even larger machines and so the way that we build it is called dgx so this is this is our Blackwell chips and it goes into dgx systems that's why we should practice so this is a dgx Blackwell this has this is air cooled has eight of these gpus inside look at the size of the heat sinks on these gpus about 15 kilowatt 15,000 watts and completely air cooled this version supports x86 and it's it goes into the infrastructure that we've been shipping Hoppers into however if you you would like to have liquid cooling we have a new system and this new system is based on this board and we call it mgx for modular and this modular system you won't be able to see this this can they see this can you see this you can the are you okay I say and so this is the mgx system and here's the two uh black Blackwell boards so this one node has four Blackwell chips these four Blackwell chips this is liquid cooled nine of them nine of them uh well 72 of these 72 of these gpus 72 of these G gpus are then connected together with a new MV link this is MV link switch fifth generation and the mvlink switch is a technology Miracle this is the most advanced switch the world's ever made the data rate is insane and these switches connect every single one of these black Wells to each other so that we have one giant 72 GPU Blackwell well the benefit the benefit of this is that in one domain one GPU domain this now looks like one GPU this one GPU has 72 versus the last generation of eight so we increased it by nine times the amount of bandwidth we've increased by 18 times the AI flops we've increased by 45 times and yet the amount of power is only 10 times this is 100 kilowatt and that is 10 kilow and that's for one now of course well you could always connect more of these together and I'll show you how to do that in a second but what's the miracle is this chip this MV link chip people are starting to awaken to the importance of this mvlink chip as it connects all these different gpus together because the large language models are so large it doesn't fit on just one GPU doesn't fit on one just just one node it's going to take the entire rack of gpus like this new dgx that I that I was just standing next to uh to to hold a large language model that are tens of trillions of parameters large mvlink which in itself is a technology Miracle is 50 billion transistors 74 ports at 400 gbits each four lengths cross-sectional bandwidth of 7 7\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: 2 terabytes per second but one of the important things is that it has mathematics inside the switch so that we can do reductions which is really important in deep learning right on the Chip And so this is what this is what um a dgx looks like now and a lot of people ask us um you know they say and there's this there's this confusion about what Nvidia does and and um how is it possible that that Nvidia became so big building gpus and so there's an impression that this is what a GPU looks like now this is a GPU this is one of the most advanced gpus in the world but this is a gamer GPU but you and I know that this is what a GPU looks like this is one GPU ladies and gentlemen dgx GPU you know the back of this GPU is the MV link spine the MV link spine is 5,000 wires two miles and it's right here this is an mvlink spine and it connects 702 gpus to each other this is a electrical mechanical Miracle the transceivers makes it possible for us to drive the entire length in Copper and as a result this switch the mvy switch mvlink switch driving the mvlink spine in Copper makes it possible for us to save 20 kilow in one rack 20 kilowatts could now be used for processing just an incredible achievement so this is the the MV links [Applause] spine wow I went down today and if you and even this is not big enough even this is not big enough for AI factories so we have to connect it all together with very high-speed networking well we have two types of networking we have infin band which has been used uh in supercomputing and AI factories all over the world and it is growing incredibly fast for us however not every data center can handle infiniband because they've already invested their ecosystem in Ethernet for too long and it does take some specialty and some expertise to manage infiniband switches and infiniband networks and so what we've done is we've brought the capabilities of infiniband to the ethernet architecture which is incredibly hard and the reason for that is this ethernet was designed for high average throughput because every single note every single computer is connected to a different person on the internet and most of the communications is the data center with somebody on the other side of the internet however deep learning in AI factories the gpus are not communicating with people on the internet mostly it's communicating with each other they're communicating with each other because they're all they're collecting partial products and they have to reduce it and then redistribute it chunks of partial products reduction redistribution that traffic is incredibly bursty and it is not the average throughput that matters it's the last arrival that matters because if you're reducing collecting partial products from everybody if I'm trying to take all of your so it's not the average throughput it's whoever gives me the answer last okay ethernet has no provision for that and so there are several things that we had to create we created an endtoend architecture so that the the Nick and the switch can communicate and we applied four different Technologies to make this possible number one Nvidia has the world's most advanced RDMA and so now we have the ability to have a network level RDMA for ethernet that is incredibly great number two we have congestion control the switch does Telemetry at all times incredibly fast and whenever the uh the uh the the gpus or the the Nyx are sending too much information we can tell them to back off so that it doesn't create hotspots number three adaptive routing ethernet needs to transmit and receive in order we see congestions or we see uh ports that are not currently being used irrespective of the ordering we will send it to the available ports and Bluefield on the other end reorders it so that it comes back in order that adaptive routing incredibly powerful and then lastly noise isolation there's more than one model being trained or something happening in the data center at all times and their noise and their traffic could get into each other and causes Jitter and so when it when the noise of one training model one model training causes the last arrival to end up too late it really slows down to training well overall remember you have you have built A5 billion dollar or3 billion doll Data Center and you're using this for training if the utilization Network utilization was 40% lower and as a result the training time was 20% longer the5 billion data center is effectively like a$6 billion doll data center so the cost is incredible the cost impact is quite High ethernet with Spectrum X basically allows us to improve the performance so much that the network is basically free and so this is really quite an achievement we're very we have a whole pipeline of ethernet products behind us this is Spectrum x800 it is uh 51\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 2 terabits per second and 256 radic the next one coming is 512 radic is one year from now 512 Radix and that's called Spectrum x800 Ultra and the one after that is x1600 but the important idea is this x800 is designed for tens of thousands tens T of thousands of gpus x800 ultra is designed for hundreds of thousands of gpus and x1600 is designed for millions of gpus the days of millions of GPU data centers are coming and the reason for that is very simple of course we want to train much larger models but very importantly in the future almost every interaction you have with the Internet or with a computer will likely have a generative AI running in the cloud somewhere and that generative AI is working with you interacting with you generating videos or images or text or maybe a digital human and so you're interacting with your computer almost all the time and there's always a generative AI connected to that some of it is on Prem some of it is on your device and a lot of it could be in the cloud these generative AIS will also do a lot of reasoning capability instead of just one shot answer they might iterate on answers so that it improve the quality of the answer before they give it to you and so the amount of generation we're going to do in the future is going to be extraordinary let's take a look at all of this put together now tonight this is our first nighttime keyote I want to thank I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight at 7:00 and and so what I'm about to show you has a new Vibe okay there's a new Vibe this is kind of the nighttime keynote Vibe so enjoy this black [Music] let's go go go go go okay [Music] [Music] [Music] come on yeah yeah yeah yeah get it y get it y let's go [Music] [Applause] the more you back the more you sa with top ey Tor made that's to speed a [Music] [Applause] now you can't do that on a morning keynote I think that style of keynote has never been done in compy Tex ever might be the last only Nvidia can pull off that only I could do that [Applause] Blackwell of course uh is the first generation of Nvidia platforms that was launched at the beginning at the right as the world knows the generative AI era is here just as the world realized the importance of AI factories just as the beginning of this new Industrial Revolution uh we have so much support nearly every OEM every computer maker every CSP every GPU Cloud Sovereign clouds even telecommunication companies Enterprises all over the world the amount of success the amount of adoption the amount of of uh enthusiasm for Blackwell is just really off the charts and I want to thank everybody for that we're not stopping there uh during this during the time of this incredible growth we want to make sure that we continue to enhance performance continue to drive down cost cost of training cost of inference and continue to scale out AI capabilities for every company to embrace the further we the further performance we drive up the Greater the cost decline Hopper platform of course was the most successful data center processor probably in history and this is just an incredible incredible success story however Blackwell is here and every single platform as you'll notice are several things you got the CPU you have the GPU you have MV link you have the Nick and you have the switch the the mvlink switch the uh connects all of the gpus together as large of a domain as we can and whatever we can do we connect it with large um very large and very highspeed switches every single generation as you'll see is not just a GPU but it's entire platform we build the entire platform we integrate the entire platform into an AI Factory supercomputer however then we this aggregate it and offer it to the world and the reason for that is because all of you could create interesting and Innovative configurations and and and all kinds of different uh uh Styles and and fit different uh data centers and different customers in different places some of it for Edge some of it for Telco and all of the different Innovation are POS possible if it would we made the systems open and make it possible for you to innovate and so we design it integrated but we offer it to you disintegrated so that you could create modular systems the Blackwell platform is here our company is on a one-year Rhythm we our basic philosophy is very simple one build the entire data center scale disaggregated and sell it to you in Parts on a one-year Rhythm and we push everything the technology limits whatever tsmc process technology will push it to the absolute limits whatever packaging technology push it to the absolute limits whatever memory technology push it to Absolute limits series technology Optics technology everything is pushed to the Limit well and then after that do everything in such a way so that all of our software runs on this entire install base software inertia is the single most important thing in computers it'll when a computer is backwards compatible and it's architecturally compatible with all the software that has already been created your ability to go to market is so much faster and so the velocity is incredible when we can take advantage of the entire installed base of software has already been created well Blackwell is here next year is Blackwell Ultra just as we had h100 and h200 you'll probably see some pretty exciting New Generation from us for black Blackwell Ultra again again push to the limits and the Next Generation Spectrum switches I mentioned well this is the very first time that this next click has been made and I'm not sure yet whe I'm going to regret this or [Applause] not we have code names in our company and uh we try to keep them very secret uh often times uh most of the employees don't even know but our next Generation platform is called Reuben the Reuben platform the Reuben platform um I'm I'm not going to spend much time on it uh I know what's going to happen you're going to take pictures of it and you're going to go look at the fine prints uh and feel free to do that so we have the Reuben platform and one year later we' have the Reuben um Ultra platform all of these chips that I'm showing you here are all in full development 100% of them and the rhythm is one year at the limits of Technology all 100% architecturally compatible so this is this is basically what Nvidia is building and all of the riches of software on top of it so in a lot of ways the last 12 years from that moment of imag net and US realizing that the future of computing was going to radically change to today is really exactly as I was holding up earlier GeForce pre 20102 and Nvidia today the company has really transformed tremendously and I want to thank all of our partners here for supporting us every step along the way this is the Nvidia black wall platform let me talk about what's next the next wave of AI is physical AI AI that understands the laws of physics AI that can work among us and so they have to understand the world model so that they understand how to interpret the world how to perceive the world they have to of course have excellent cognitive capabilities so they can understand us understand what we asked and perform the tasks in the future robotics is a much more p pervasive idea of course when I say robotics there's a humanoid robotics that's usually the representation of that but that's not at all true everything is going to be robotic all of the factories will be robotic the factories will orchestrate robots and those robots will be building products that are robotic robots interacting with robots building products that are robotic well in order for us to do that we need to make some breakthroughs and let me show you the video the era of Robotics has arrived one day everything that moves will be autonomous researchers and companies around the world are developing robots powered by physical AI physical AIS are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world multimodal llms are breakthroughs that enable robots to learn perceive and understand the world around them and plan how they'll act and from Human demonstrations robots can now learn the skills required to interact with the world using gross and fine motor skills one of the integral Technologies for advancing robotics is reinforcement learning just as llms need rhf or reinforcement learning from Human feedback to learn particular skills generative physical AI can learn skills using reinforcement learning from physics feedback in a simulated World these simulation environments are where robots learn to make decisions by performing actions in a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics in these robot gyms a robot can learn to perform complex and dynamic tasks safely and quickly refining their skills through millions of Acts of trial and error we built Nvidia Omniverse as the operating system where physical a can be created Omniverse is a development platform for virtual world simulation combining realtime physically based rendering physics simulation and generative AI Technologies in Omniverse robots can learn how to be robots they learn how to autonomously manipulate objects with Precision such as grasping and handling objects or navigate environments autonomously finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles and Hazards learning in Omniverse minimizes the Sim to real Gap and maximizes the transfer of learned beh Behavior building robots with generative physical AI requires three computers Nvidia AI supercomputers to train the models Nvidia Jetson Orin and Next Generation Jetson Thor robotic supercomputer to run the models an Nvidia Omniverse where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds we build the platforms acceleration libraries and AI models needed by developers and companies and allow them to use any or all of the stacks that suit them best the next wave of AI is here robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize [Music] Industries this isn't the future this is happening now there are several ways that we're going to serve the market the first we're going to create platforms for each type of robotic systems one for robotic factories and warehouses one for robots that manipulate things one for robots that move and one for uh robots that are humanoid and so each one of these robotic robotics platform is like almost everything else we do a computer acceler libraries and pre-train models computers acceleration libraries pre-train models and we test everything we train everything and integrate everything inside Omniverse where Omniverse is as the video was saying where robots learn how to be robots now of course the ecosystem of robotic warehouses is really really complex it takes a lot of companies a lot of tools a lot of technology to build a modern warehouse and warehouses are increasingly robotic one of these things days will be fully robotic and so in each one of these ecosystems we have sdks and apis that are connected into the software industry sdks and apis connected into Edge AI industry um and companies and then also of course uh systems that are designed for plc's and robotic systems for the odms it's then integrated by integrators uh created for ultimately uh building warehouses uh for customers here we have an example of kenmac building a robotic warehouse for giant giant group okay and then here now let's talk about factories factories has a completely different ecosystem and foxcon is building some of the world's most advanced factories their ecosystem again Edge Computers and Robotics software for designing the factories the workflows programming the robots and of course PLC computers that orchestrate uh the digital factories and the AI factories we have sdks uh that are connected into each one of these ecosystems as well this is happening all over Taiwan foxcon has buil is building digital twins of their factories Delta is building digital twins of their factories by the way half is real half half is digital half is Omniverse pegatron is building digital twins of their robotic factories wistron is building digital twins of their robotic factories and this is really cool this is a video of foxc con's new Factory let's take a look demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing is skyrocketing as the World modernizes traditional data centers into generative AI factories foxcon the world's largest electronics manufacturer is gearing up to meet this Demand by building robotic factories with Nvidia Omniverse and AI Factory planners use Omniverse to integrate facility and Equipment data from leading industry applications like seamen team Center X and Autodesk Revit in the digital twin they optimize floor layout and line configurations and locate optimal camera placements to monitor future operations with Nvidia Metropolis powered Vision AI virtual integration saves planners on the enormous cost of physical change orders during construction the foxcon teams use the digital twin as the source of Truth to communicate and validate accurate equipment layout the Omniverse digital twin is also the robot gym where foxcon developers train and test Nvidia ISAC AI applications for robotic perception and manipulation and Metropolis AI applications for Sensor Fusion in Omniverse foxcon simulates two robot AIS before deploying run times to Jets and computers on the assembly line they simulate Isaac manipulator libraries and AI models for automated Optical inspection for object identification defect detection and trajectory planning to transfer hgx systems to the test pods they simulate Isaac perceptor powered fobot amrs as they perceive and move about their environment with 3D mapping and reconstruction with Omniverse foxcon builds their robotic factories that orchestrate robots running on Nvidia ISAC to build Nvidia AI supercomputers which which in turn train boxon [Music] [Applause] robots so a robotic Factory is designed with three computers train the AI on Nvidia AI you have the robot running on the PLC systems uh for orchestrating the the the uh the factories and then you of course simulate everything inside Omniverse well the robotic arm and the robotic amrs are also the same way three computer systems the difference is the two omniverses will come together so they'll share one virtual space when they share one virtual space that robotic arm will become inside the robotic Factory and again three three uh three computers and we provide the computer the acceleration layers and pre-train uh pre-train AI models we've connected Nvidia manipulator and Nvidia Omniverse with Seamans the world's leading Industrial Automation software and systems company this is really a fantastic partnership and they're working on factories all over the world semantic pick aai now integrates Isaac manipulator and sematic pick AI uh runs operates ABB CA yasawa uh Fook uh Universal robotics um and techman and so semmens is a fantastic integration we have all kinds of other Integrations let's take a look arcbest is integrating Isaac perceptor into Vox smart autonomy robots for enhanced object recognition and human motion tracking in Material Handling byd Electronics is integrating Isaac manipulator and percep ctor into their AI robots to enhance manufacturing efficiencies for Global customers ideal works is building Isaac perceptor into their iwos software for AI robots in Factory Logistics intrinsic an alphabet company is adopting Isaac manipulator into their Flow State platform to advance robot grasping Gideon is integrating Isaac perceptor into Trey AI powered forklifts to advance AI enabled Logistics Argo robotics is adopting Isaac perceptor into perception engine for Advanced Vision based amrs Solomon is using Isaac manipulator AI models in their acup piic 3D software for industrial manipulation techman robot is adopting Isaac Sim and manipulator into TM flow accelerating automated Optical inspection pteridine robotics is integrating Isaac manipulator into po scope X for cobots and Isaac perceptor into mere amrs vention is integrating Isaac manipulator into machine Logic for AI manipulation [Music] robots robotics is here physical AI is here this is not science fiction and it's being used all over Taiwan and just really really exciting and that's the factory the robots inside and of course all the products are going to be robotics there are two very high volume robotics products one of course is the self-driving car or cars that have a great deal of autonomous capability Nvidia again builds the entire stack next year we're going to go to production with the Mercedes Fleet and after that in 2026 the jlr fleet uh we offer the full stack to the world however you're welcome to take whichever Parts uh which whichever layer of our stack just as the entire the entire uh uh Drive stack is open the next high volume robotics product that's going to be manufactured by robotic factories with robots inside will likely be humanoid robots and this has great progress in recent years in both the cognitive capability because of foundation models and also the world understanding capability that we're in the process of developing I'm really excited about this area because obviously the easiest robot to adapt into the world are human or robots because we built the world for us we also have the vast the most amount of data to train these robots than other types of robots because we have the same uh physique and so the amount of training data we can provide through demonstration capabilities and video capabilities is going to be really great and so we're going to see a lot of progress in this area well I think we have um some robots that we' like to uh welcome there we go about my [Applause] size and we have we have some friends to join us so the fut the future of robot robotics is here the next wave of AI and and of course you know Taiwan builds computers with keyboards you build computers for your pocket you build computers for data centers in the cloud in the future you're going to build computers that walk and computers that roll you know around and um so these are all just computers and as as it turns out uh the technology is very similar to the technology of building um all of the other computers that you already build today so this is going to be a really extraordinary uh Journey for us well uh I want to thank I want to I want to thank I want to I have I've I've made one last video if you don't mind uh something that that uh uh uh we we really enjoyed making um and if you let's run it [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you I love you guys thank [Applause] you thank you all for coming have a great comput text thank [Applause] you I will

[Music] [Music] once get thank you for joining us yeah digal Twins and me we been I [Music] feeled hey I am awake for the new day feeling the sun upon my face I'm all the bad vibes away look to the sky I have this moment inside the glove I am the Sun up so high above I am the star you are thinking know take a minute now take a minute to see take a minute now we are put in the SE this is everything that I could ever KN on the top again in the land of the free and e e e hello everyone welcome sigraph it is my first sigraph I'm so excited to be here I'm so excited to speak to all of you and I'm so excited to speak to Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen hang great to see you again thank you great to see you welcome to sigraph Lauren Welcome To My Hood you're regular here huh hey everybody great to see you guys Jensen it is like 99 degrees outside I know it's freezing in here isn't it I mean I don't know I'm shaking leather jacket yeah feels great looks good too all right so you have I'm wearing a brand new one oh a brand new one yeah how many of those do you have I don't know but Lori got me a new one for sigraph she said you're excited about cigar here's a new jacket go go do good job I look sharp thank you all right uh you have a long history of sigraph I mean when you think about the history of this conference which has been going on since 1974 and you think about the history of Nvidia from the 1990s onward where your DNA was really in you know know computer Graphics uh helping to make beautiful Graphics what is the significance of Nvidia being here today right now at a conference like sigraph well you know uh sigraph used to be about computer Graphics now it's about computer graphics and generative AI it's about simulation it's about generative Ai and and we all know that the Journey of Nvidia which started out in computer Graphics as you said um uh really brought us here and so I made a cartoon for you I made a cartoon for you of our journey did you make it or did J of AI make it I I I had it hang on a second I had it made I had it made um that's what CEOs do we don't do anything we just have it be done it kind of starts something like this hey guys would it be great if we had a cartoon and it Illustrated some of the most important milestones in the computer industry and how it led to Nvidia and where we are today and and so we Illustrated and also do it in three hours and do three hours right and and so this is this cartoon here is really terrific so these are some of the some of the most important moments in the computer industry uh the IBM system 360 of course the invention of modern Computing uh the teapot 1975 the Utah teapot 1979 Ray tracing um uh Turner wited uh one of the great researchers Nvidia researcher for a long time uh 1986 programmable shading uh of course uh most of the animated movies that we see today wouldn't be possible if not for programmable shading originally done on the CRA supercomputer uh led to uh what and then in 1993 Nvidia was founded Chris Curtis and I founded the company 19 1995 Windows PC revolutionized uh the personal computer industry uh put a personal computer in every home and every desk uh multimedia PC was uh was invented 2001 we invented uh the first programmable shading GPU and and that that really uh drove uh vast majority of nvidia's Journey up to that point But at the background of everything we were doing was accelerated computing and accelerate and and we believe that you could create a type of computing model that could augment the general purpose Computing so that you can solve problems that normal computers can't and the application we chose first was computer graphics and it was probably one of the best decisions we ever made because computer Graphics was insanely computationally in intensive and remained so uh for the entire 31 years that that Nvidia has been here and since the beginning of computer Graphics in fact required a crazy supercomputer to render some of the original scenes so it kind of tells you how computationally intensive it was and it was also incredibly high volume because we applied computer Graphics to an application at the time that uh wasn't mainstream 3D Graphics video games the combination of very large volume very complicated Computing problem led to a very large R&D budget for us which drove the flywheel of our company that observation we made in 1993 was spoton and it led us to be able to Pioneer the work that we're doing in accelerated Computing we tried it many times Cuda was of course the Revolutionary version but prior to that we had a Computing model we call CG C for graphics C on top of gpus and so we've been working on accelerated Computing for a long time uh promoting and evangelizing Cuda getting Cuda everywhere and putting on every single one of our gpus so that this computing model was compatible with the with any application that was written for it irrespective of which generation of our processors that was a great decision and one one day in 2012 we made our first Contact you know Star Trek first Contact with artificial intelligence that first Contact was alexnet it was in 2012 very big moment uh we made the observation that alexnet was an incredible breakthrough in computer vision but at the core of it deep learning was deeply profound that it was a new way of writing software instead of Engineers given input imagining what the output was going to be write algorithms we now have a computer that given an input and example outputs would figure out what the program is in the middle that observation and that we can use this technique to solve a whole bunch of problems that previously wasn't solvable was a great observation and we changed everything in our company to pursue it from the processor to the systems to the software stack all the algorithms Nvidia basic research pivoted towards working on deep learning uh by the way this is a great place for research as you know nvidia's uh passionate about about uh uh sigraph and this year we have 20 papers that are at the intersection of generative Ai and simulation and so in 20 2016 uh we introduced the first computer we built for deep learning and we called it djx1 and I delivered the first djx1 outside of our company I built it for NVIDIA to build models for self-driving cars and Robotics and such and and generative AI for graphics uh but we uh somebody saw an example of djx1 Elon reached out to me and said hey I would love to have one of those for a startup company we're starting and so I delivered the first one to a company at the time uh that knew nobody knew about called open a I and so that was 2016 uh 2017 was the Transformer uh that revolutionized modern uh machine learning modern deep learning in 2018 right here at sigraph we announced RTX the world's first realtime interactive R Tracer R tracing platform we call it RTX it was such a big deal that we changed the name of GTX which everybody refer to our graphics cards as to RTX uh another shout out for for uh uh a great researcher his name is Steph Parker uh many of you know he's been coming to C for a long time uh he passed this year and uh he was a a he was one of the one of the core uh Pioneer researchers behind realtime R raate tracing and we miss them dearly and so anyways uh and you mentioned last year during your sigraph keynote that RTX R tracing extreme was one of the big important moments when computer Graphics met AI That's right but that had been happening for a while actually so what was so what was so important about RTX in 2018 well RTX in 2018 so you know we uh we accelerated uh Ray traversal and bounding box uh detection and and um uh and we made it possible to uh use a parallel processor to accelerate rate tracing um but even then we were rate tracing at about you know frame every call it you know 10 frames maybe every second let's say maybe five frames every second depending on on how how many how many Rays we're talking about tracing and we were doing it at 1080 resolution uh obviously video games uh need a lot more than that obviously real-time Graphics need more than that this crowd definitely knows what that means but for the folks who are watching online who don't work in this field I mean this is basically a way of really manipulating light in computer Graphics simulating how a light interacts with versus through right happening in real time that's right the rendering processes used to take a really long time when you were making something it used to take a Cay supercomputer to render just a few pixels and now we have our RTX to accelerate that rate tracing but it was interactive it was real time but it wasn't fast enough to be uh a video game and so we realized that that we needed a big boost probably something along the lines of 20x or so maybe 50x or so boost and so uh the team uh invented dlss which basically renders one pixel while it uses AI to infer a whole bunch of other pixels and so we basically taught an AI that is conditioned on what it saw and then say fills in fills in the dots for everything else and now we're able to render fully Ray Trace fully path Trace simulation ations at 4K resolution at 300 frames per second made possible by by Ai and so 2018 came along uh 2022 as we all know chat GPT came out but the and what's that again chat GPT you know that yes open AI chat GPT a revolutionary revolutionary new uh new capability Ai and fastest growing service in history um but the two things that I wanted to highlight since since jgp the industry researchers um many of them in the room has figured out how to use AI to learn everything not just words but to learn the meaning of images and videos and 3D chemicals protein physics thermal dynamics fluid dynamics particle physics it's figured out the meaning of these uh all these different modalities and since then not only have we learned it we can now generate it and so you could that's the reason why you can go from text to images text to 3D images to text 3D to text text to video so on so forth text to proteins text to chemicals and so now generative AI has been uh made possible and this is really the Revolutionary time that we're in just about every industry is going to be affected by this just based on based on some of the examples I've already given you whether it's scientific Computing trying to do a better job uh predicting the weather with a lot less energy to uh augmenting and collaborating with with us uh creators to generate images or you know generating virtual scenes for industrial digitalization and very importantly robotics self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative Ai and so here we are in this brand new way of doing things and so let me just very quickly Lauren if you look at where we started in the upper left in 1964 uh the way that software was programmed human Engineers programming software now we have machines that are learning how to program the software de writing software that no humans can solving problems that we we could barely imagine before and now because we have generative AI a new way of developing software you know you you you I don't know if you know do you know Andre karpathy he's a really really terrific researcher I met him when he was at Stanford and and uh he coined the original way of doing software software 1\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 0 machine learning to be software 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 and now really we're moving toward software 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 0 because these generative AIS in the future instead of using machine learning to learn a new AI for every researcher you'll probably start with pre-trained models Foundation models that are already pre-trained and the way that we develop software could very very much be like assembling teams with Experts of various AI capabilities some that are using uh tools some that are able to generate you know special things and then a general purpose AI that's really good at reasoning that's connecting this this network of AIS together solving problems like team solve problems and so software 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 0 is here I've gotten the sense from talking to you recently that you are optimistic that this these generative AI tools will become more controllable more accurate we all know that there are issues with hallucinations uh low quality outputs that people are using these tools and they're maybe not getting exactly the output that they're hoping for right meanwhile they're using a lot of energy which we're going to talk about why are you so optimistic about this what is what do you think is pointing Us in the direction of this generative AI actually becoming that much more useful and controllable well uh the big breakthrough of Chad GPT uh was reinforcement learning human feedback which was uh the way of using humans to produce the right answers or the best answers to align the AI on our core values or align our AI on the skills that we would like it to perform that's probably the just the extraordinary breakthrough that made it possible for them to open chat GPT for everyone everyone to use other breakthroughs have have uh arrived since then Guard railing which uh which causes the AI to focus its energy or Focus its response in a particular domain so that uh it doesn't wander off and pontificate about all kinds of stuff that you ask it about it would only focus on the things that it's been trained to do align to perform and um uh that it it has deep knowledge in the third the third breakthrough is called uh retrieval augmented generation which basically is vectorized or data that has been uh embedded so that we understand the meaning of that data and so it's a more authoritative data set it goes beyond just the trained data set and it actually pulls from other sources that's right it's not just pre-ra data source it's and something you know for example uh it might be uh all of the articles that you've ever written all of the papers that you've ever written and so now it becomes uh something an AI That's authoritative on your uh and it could be essentially a uh a chatbot of you uh so everything that I've ever written or ever said could be vectorized and then created into a semantic database and then before an AI responds it would uh figure it would look at look at your prompt and it would uh it would uh search uh the appropriate content from that Vector database and then augment it um in its gener generative process and you think that that is one of the most important factors these three combinations really made it possible for us to do that with text now the thing that's really cool is that we are now starting to figure out how to do that with visuals right and you know sigraph is really about a lot about images and and generation and so if you look at today's generative AI uh you could give it a a prompt and it goes into uh in this particular case this is a uh edify uh AI model that Nvidia created it's a 2d text to 2D Foundation model it's multimodal and um uh we used uh we partnered with GTI to use uh their library of data uh to train uh an AI model and so this is a a text to uh 2D image and you also created this slide personally right I well I had I personally had the slide created and so imagine I'm the prompt and then there's a team that that's kind of like a generative Ai and then magically uh this slide shows up and so so here here's a prompt uh and this could be a prompt for somebody who owns a brand it could be a brand of um for in this case Coca-Cola it could be a car it could be a luxury product it could be anything and so uh you you use the prompt and generate the image however as you know it's hard to control this prompt and it may hallucinate uh it may um uh create it in such a way that it's not exactly what you want and to fine-tune this using words is really really hard because as you know words is very low dimensional ity it's extremely compressed in its content but it's it's very imprecise and so the ability for us to now control that image uh is difficult to do and so we've created a way that allows us to uh control and align that with more conditioning and so the way you do that is we create another model and this model for example allows us to text to 3D on the bottom it's called and it's edify 3D one of our foundation models we've created this AI Foundry where Partners can come and work with us and we create the model for them with their data we invent the model and they bring their data and we uh create a model that they can take with them is it their data only uses their data so this only uses all of the data that's available on Shutterstock uh that they have have the rights to to use the train and so we now use prompt generator 3D we put that in Omniverse Omniverse uh as you know is a is a place where you could compose uh data and content from a lot of different modalities it could be 3D it could be AI it could be animation it could be materials and so we use Omniverse to compose all of these multimodality uh data and now you can control it you could you could change the pose you could change the placement you could change whatever you like and then you use that image out of Omniverse to condition The Prompt okay so you take what comes out of Omniverse you now augment it with the prompt it's a little bit like augment retrieval augment a mented generation this is now 3D augmented generation Getty uh the edified model is multimodal so it understand the image understands the prompt and it uses it in combination to create a new image so now this is a controlled image and so this way we can use uh generative AI as a as a collaborator as a you know as a partner to to work with us um and uh uh we can generate images exactly the way we like it how does this translate to the physical world how does it translate to something like robotics well we're going to talk about robotics but one of the things that I would love to show you and I had this made not by myself well I had it made myself okay this is an Incredible video and this is a uh this is a work that is done by wpp uh Shutterstock uh working with uh some of the brand uh world class world famous brands that you'll you'll know let's run the video Let's show the build me a table in an empty room surrounded by chairs in a busy restaurant build me a table with tacos and bowls of salsa in the Morning Light build me a car on an empty road surrounded by trees buy a modern house build me a house with hills in the distance and bales of hay in the Evening Sun build me a tree in an empty field build me hundred of them in all Direction with bushes and Vines hanging in between building a giant brain forest with exotic flowers and rays of sunlight isn't that incredible and so so let so this is so this is this is what happened we taught we taught an AI how to speak USD open USD and so the young the the the girl is speaking to Omniverse Omniverse generates the USD and use USD search to then find the catalog of uh 3D objects that it has it composes the scene using words and and then um generative AI uh uses that augmentation to generate uh to condition the generation process and and so therefore uh the work that you do could be much much better controlled you could even collaborate with people because you can collaborate in Omniverse and you can collaborate in 3D it's hard to collaborate uh in 2D and so we can collaborate in 3D augment the generation process I imagine a lot of people in this room who aren't just technical but they're also storytellers this is a very technical room storytellers see something like this there's like 90% phds in here and think I'm not even going to ask you to do a raising of your hand but I'm sure that would be fascinating so they see something like this I see something like this and I think okay that's pretty amazing you are speeding up rendering times you're creating images out of nothing there are probably just as many people thinking what does this mean for my job where do you draw the line between this is augmenting and helping people where do you see the line being drawn and this is replacing certain things that humans do well that's what tools do uh we invent tools here this you know this conference is about inventing technology that ultimately ends up being a tool and that Tool uh either accelerates our work um uh collaborates with us so that we could do uh better work or even bigger work uh do work that's uh impossible before and so I think what you're going to what you you'll likely see is that generative AI uh is now going to be more controllable than before we've been able to do that with using uh Rags retrieval augmented generation to control uh text generation better reducing hallucination now we're using Omniverse with generative AI to control generative uh images better and reduce hallucination both of those tools uh help us be more productive and do things that we otherwise can't do and so I think I think um for all of the artists in the world I what I would say is is uh jump on this tool give it a try um imagine the stories that you're going to be able to tell uh with these tools and um uh and with respect to jobs uh I would say that it is very likely all of our jobs are going to be changed in what way well my job is going to change um the way in the future uh I'm going to be prompting a whole bunch of AIS uh everybody will have an AI that is an assistant and so every single company every single company every single job within the company will have AIS that are assistant to them our software programmers as you so you know now have AIS that help them program uh all all of our software Engineers have AIS that help them debug software uh we have AIS that help our chip designers design chips uh without without AI uh Hopper wouldn't have been possible without AI Blackwell wouldn't be possible you know today we're this week we're sampling we're sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world they're under people's chairs right now I think if you just look if you get a GPU and you and I yeah you get a GPU you get a GPU yeah that's right supply chain we all we all we all wish yeah yeah and so so um I none none of the work that we do would be possible anymore without without generative Ai and uh that's increasingly the case with uh uh uh Our IT department helping our employees be more productive uh it's increasingly the case with our supply chain team optimizing Supply uh to be as efficient as possible um or our data center team using AI to manage the data center to save as much energy as possible you mentioned Omniverse before yeah uh that's not new but the idea that more generative AI would be within the Omniverse helping people create these simulations or digital twins yeah that's what we're announcing this week by the way Omniverse now Omniverse now uh understands uh text to USD um it could understand text to uh and has a semantic database so that it could do search of all the 3D objects um and uh that's how that that young lady was able to to say fill fill uh the scene with a whole bunch of trees uh describing how she would like the trees to be organized and somehow populates it with all these 3D trees then when that when that's done that 3D scene then goes into a generative AI uh uh model which turns turns it into a photorealistic model and if you want the the Ford truck to not be augmented but to use the the the actual brand um brand ground Truth uh then it would it would honor that and keep that uh keep that in the or in the final scene and so so I think if you if you if you do that uh so one of the things that that we talked about is how every single every single group in the company uh will have will have ai assistance and and um there's a lot of question lately about about um uh whether all this infrastructure that we're building is leading to productive work in companies I just gave you an example of how generative AI is impossible without without uh Nvidia nvidia's designs would be impossible without generative AI so we use it to transform the way we work but we also use it uh in many examples that I've just shown you in creating new products and new technology that either makes possible uh rate tracing in real time uh or Omniverse that we can now uh uh imagine and help us uh create much larger scenes um or uh our self-driving car work or our robotics work uh none of that none of that new capability would be possible without it and so one of the things that that we're announcing here uh this week is uh the concept of uh digital uh agents uh digital AIS uh that will augment every single job in the company and so uh one of the one of the the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service and every single group every single company has customer service every single industry has customer service uh and in the future uh it's going today it's it's humans uh doing customer service but in the future my guess is that it's going to be human still but AI in the loop and the benefit of that is that you'll be able to uh uh retain uh the the um uh the experiences of all the customer service agents that you have and capture that institutional knowledge that you can then run into analytics that you can then uh use to create uh better services for your customers uh the the just now I showed you a a Omniverse augmented generation for images this is a rag this is a uh retrieval augmented generative Ai and the thing that we're doing is is uh We've created this customer service basically uh microservice that sits in the cloud and it's going to be available I think today or tomorrow and you can come and try it and we connected to it a digital human front end basically an IO uh the io of an AI that has the ability to uh speak make eye contact with you um an animate in an empathetic way um and uh uh you could decide to connect your chat chat gbt or your AI I to the digital human or you can connect um uh your digital human to our uh retrieval augmented generation uh customer service AI uh so however you like to do it we're a platform company so irrespective of which piece you would like to use uh they're completely open source and you can come and use the pieces that you like uh if you would like the incredible digital human rendering technology that we've created for uh rendering beautiful faces uh which requires subsurface scattering with path tracing this breakthrough uh is really quite incredible and it makes it possible for us amazing Graphics researchers welcome to sigraph 2024 so it makes it possible to animate uh using an AI so uh you you chat with the AI it generates text that text then is translated uh to sound text to speech that speech the sound then animates the face and and then RTX path tracing um does the does the rendering of the digital human and so all of this is available for developers to use and you could you could decide which parts you would like to use how are you thinking about the ethics of something like this you're unleashing this to developers to Graphics artists but these are being Unleashed into the world y do you think a chatbot like that a a very human like visual chatbot should say that it's a chatbot what is it so human that people start mistaking it for humans they're emotionally vulnerable it's it's still it's still pretty it's still pretty robotic and I think that that's not a terrible thing you know we're going to stay we're going to be robotic for for some time I think it we've made we've made uh this digital human technology uh quite realistic but you and I know it's still a it's still a robot and so I I think um uh that's not a that's not a a horrible way um it is the case that there are many many different applications where the human engagement is much uh much more engaging uh having a human representation or near human representation than a text box uh maybe somebody needs companion or Healthcare needs to advise um somebody who is an outpatient uh who had just gone home uh you know helping elderlies um you know there's a whole bunch of applications uh a tutor which to educate a child um all these different applications are better off having somebody who is much more human and being able to connect with uh with the audience that's interesting yeah what I hear you talking a lot about today these are software developments right they're relying on your gpus But ultimately this is software this is NVIDIA going further up the stack meanwhile there are some companies some folks in the generative AI space who are in software and Cloud services but they're looking to go further down the stack right they might be developing their own chips or tpus that are competitive with what you are doing how crucial is this software strategy to Nvidia maintaining its lead and actually fulfilling some of these promises of growth that people are looking at for NVIDIA right now well um we've always been a software company um and even first and the reason for that is because accelerated Computing is not general purpose Computing general purpose Computing can take any c program or C Supply program Python and just run it and almost everybody's uh program can be compiled to run effectively unfortunately when you want to accelerate fluid dynamics you have to understand the the algorithms of fluid dynamics so that you could uh refactor it in such way that it could be accelerated and you have to design an accelerator you have to design the cou at GPU so that it understands the algorithms so that it could do a good job accelerating it and the benefit of course is that we can by doing so by redesigning the whole stack we can accelerate applications 20 40 50 times 100 times for example uh we just put um Nvidia gpus in in uh gcp uh running pandas uh which is the world's leading uh data science platform and we accelerated from 50 to 100x over general purpose Computing uh in the case of deep learning over the course of last 10 to 12 years or so uh We've accelerated deep learning by a million times which is the reason why it's now possible for us to create these large language models a million times speed up a million times reduction in cost and energy is what made it possible for us to make General generative AI possible but that's not that's that's by designing a new processor a new system tensor core gpus the mvlink switch fabric uh is completely groundbreaking for AI of course the systems itself the algorithms the distributed computing uh uh uh Library we call Megatron that everybody uses um tensor rtlm those are algorithms and if you don't understand the algorithms the the applications above it it's really hard to figure out how to design that whole stack what is the most important part of Nvidia software ecosystem for nvidia's future well every single one of it takes a new library we call it dsl's domain specific Library um in in uh in generative AI that DSL is called qnn uh for SQL processing uh data frames is called qdf and so if you go SQL pandas uh CDF is what makes it possible for us to accelerate that for Quantum emulation it's called K Quantum uh uh C fft we got a whole bunch of coups uh computational lithography which makes it makes it possible for us to uh help the industry Advance the next generation of processed technology called K litho um you know the the number of coups it goes on and on every time we introduce a domain specific Library it exposes accelerated Computing to a new market and so as you see it takes that collaboration the the the the the um uh the full stack of the library and the architecture and the go to market and developers and the ecosystems around it to open up a new field and so it's not just about building the accelerator you have to build a whole stack nvidia's dependent on a lot of things going right your your foray into the future your Innovation depends on a lot of things going right you have to continue pushing the laws of physics you do have competitors who are nipping at your heels at all times we've talked about this what keeps you up at night uh you're also somewhat relling on the geopolitical stability last night just so you know elevation drink some water that's what they told me but it was it was too late by the time I learned about it this morning I I woke up with a a terrible headache elevation that's what was last night okay so elevation uh but truly you have to keep pushing the laws of physics you have competitors who are nipping at your heels both on the software and Hardware side you are somewhere Aliant on the geopolitical stability of the South China Sea uh geopolitics uh so much going on right now you're reminding me it's it's it's super hard building a company it is you but you've had a lot of you're making me nervous I was fine before there's so many things that he wants to go back to showing you slides uh but truly you've and you've had you've had a lot of Tailwinds and I'm just you know how optimistic are you that these the things are going to keep trending in your direction things have never trended in our Direction uh you have to will the future into existence accelerated Computing you know the world wants general purpose computing and the reason for that is because it's easy you just you just have the software it just runs twice as fast every single year don't even think about it and you know every five years is 10 times faster every 10 years is 100 times faster what's not to love but of course you can shrink a transistor but you can't shrink an atom and eventually uh the CPU architecture uh ran its course and so we it's not sensible anymore uh as the technology doesn't give us those leaps that a general purpose instrument could be good at everything you know could be good at these incredible things from Deep learning to Quantum simulation to molecular Dynamics the fluid dynamics right so on the computer graphics and so we created this accelerated Computing architecture to do that um but that that that fights that fight that's headwind do you see what I'm saying because general purpose Computing is the easy way to do it we've been doing it for 60 years why not keep doing it and so so accelerated Computing was only possible because we we deliver such extreme extraordinary speedups at a time when energy is becoming more scarce um at a time when when um uh we no longer could just ride the CPU curve any longer dard scaling is has has really uh ended and um I and so we need another approach and and that's why that's why we're here but notice every single time we want to open up a new market like qdf in order to do data processing data processing is probably what a third of the world data a third of the world's Computing every company does data processing and most companies data is in data frames you know in tabular format and so in order to create an acceleration library for tabular formats was insanely hard because what's inside those tables could be floating Point numbers 64-bit integers it could be you know numbers and letters and all kinds of stuff and so we have to figure out a way to go compute all that and so so you see that almost every single time we want to grow into something you have to go and learn it that's the reason why we're working on robotics that's the reason why we're working on autonomous vehicles to understand the algorithms that's necessary to open up that market and to understand the Computing layer underneath it so that we can deliver extraordinary results and so as you could see each each time we open up a new market um healthare digital biology the work with the amazing work we're doing there with biion Nemo and uh uh parab bricks for Gene sequencing every single time we open up a new market it just requires us to reinvent everything of that Computing and so there's nothing easy about it generative AI takes up a lot of energy I'm just saying my job's super hard but your assistance you're your AI assistants are going to make it easier right what's that somebody's got to Pat my back hey little Applause you guys Cher on yeah go ahead uh let's talk about energy yeah generative AI incredibly energy intensive y uh I am going to read from my note cards here uh According to some research chat gbt a single query takes up nearly 10 times the electricity to process a single Google search uh data centers consume 1 to 2% of overall worldwide energy but some say that it could be as much as 3 to 4% some say as much as 6% by the end of the decade uh data center workloads tripled between 25 uh 2015 and 2019 that was only 2019 um AI generative AI is taking up a large portion of all of that is there going to be enough energy to fulfill the demand of what you want to build and do yeah um yes and um a couple of observations so first there there are two or three um or or three or four uh model makers that are pushing to Frontier a couple of years ago uh they're they're probably three times that many this year but it's still it's still single digit you know it's very high single digit but call a 10 that are pushing the frontiers of um of models and the size of the models are uh call it uh twice as large every year maybe maybe uh faster than that and in order to train a model that's twice as large you need you know more than twice as much data and so the computational load is growing um probably uh by you know call it a factor of four each year just for simple simple simple thinking now that's one of the reasons why Blackwell uh is is uh so highly anticipated because we accelerated the application uh so much using the same amount of energy and so this is an example of accelerating applications uh uh at constant energy constant cost you're making it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper now the important thing though is I've only highlighted 10 companies the world has tons of companies and their data centers everywhere and Nvidia is selling gpus to a whole lot of companies and a whole lot of different data centers and so question is what's happening at the core the first thing that's actually happening is the end of CPU scaling and the beginning of accelerated Computing data processing um uh just text completion speech recognition all of those kind of basic AI things that are that are used um recommender systems uh that are used in in data centers all over the world they are moving everyone is moving from CPUs to accelerated Computing because uh they want to save energy accelerated Computing helps you save so much energy 20 times 50 times in doing the same processing so the first thing that we have to do you know as a society is accelerate every application we can can if you're doing spark data processing ex run it with accelerated spark so that you could reduce the amount of energy necessary by 20 times if you're doing SQL processing do SQL um accelerated SQL so that you could reduce the power by 20 times and so uh uh if you're doing weather simulation accelerate it when you're doing uh whatever scientific simulation you're doing accelerated uh image processing accelerated a lot of those applications used to be uh running on CPUs and general purpose Computing all of that should be accelerated going forward that's the first thing that's happening now it is that reducing the amount of energy being used all over the world absolutely the density of our gpus and density of accelerated Computing is higher energy density is higher but the amount of energy used is dramatically lower so that's the first thing that's happening of course then generative AI generative AI is probably consuming let's pick a very large number probably you know 1% or so of the world's energy but remember even if the data centers uh consume 4% of the world the goal of generative AI is not training the goal of generative AI is inference and the inference ideally we create new models for predicting weather uh predicting new materials allow us to uh um uh optimize uh our supply chain reduce the amount of energy consumed and wasted gasoline uh as we deliver products and so the goal is actually to reduce the energy consumed of the 96% and so uh very importantly you have to think about gener about AI from a longitudinal perspective not just going to school but what happens after going to school you and I both went to Stanford Stanford's not inexpensive um I think you studied something slightly different though yeah yeah sure it's a big school it's worked out well for it's worked out well for both of us and so and so so the goal of course is is is going to school is important uh but of course the important thing is is really after school and all of the contributions that we're made we're able to make the society and so generative AI is going to increase productivity it's going to Ena enable us to discover new science make things more energy efficient um don't let me don't let me finish without without showing you uh the next and so so that the lights just came on because why we were talking about energy and all of a sudden it's like the Earth was like okay Tamp down the energy usage folks I thought I thought they were G am I getting Chang we still have a few minutes so I mean I hope so I mean I'm not I'm not going to get off the stage until Mark comes on here and kicks me off how about that he's not going to do that he's a great guy so anyways uh think think think about generative AI um longitudinally and all the impact of of generative AI the second thing the next thing I'll say about generative AI is remember in the the traditional way doing Computing is called retrieval based Computing everything is pre-recorded all the stories are written pre-recorded all the images are pre-recorded all the videos are pre-recorded and so and so everything is stored off in a data center somewhere pre-recorded generative AI reduces the amount of energy necessary to go run to a data center over the network re retrieve something and bring it over the network don't forget the data center is not the only place that consumes energy the world's Data Center only rep that is only 40% of the total Computing done 60% of the energy is consumed on the internet moving the electrons around moving the bits and bites around and so generative AI is going to reduce the amount of energy on the internet because instead of having to go retrieve the information we can generate it right there on the spot because we understand the context we probably have some uh content already on the device and we can generate the response so that you don't have to go retrieve it uh somewhere else well part of that is also moving atoms around right one last thing I got to tell you laen one last thing I remember AI doesn't care where it goes to school today's data centers are are built near the power grid where Society is of course because that's where we need it in the future you're going to see data centers being built in different parts of the world where there's excess energy it's just that it costs a lot of money to bring that energy to society maybe it's in a desert maybe it's uh in places that has a lot of sustainable energy but it's not a lot of water well uh there's plenty of water as well it just happens to be undrinkable water and so uh we can use we can use water that are uh we we can we can put data centers where there's less population and um more energy okay just don't don't forget that there's there's plenty there's a lot of energy coming from the Sun there's a lot of energy in the world and what we need to do is move data centers out closer to where there's excess energy and not put everything near population well part AI doesn't care where it's trained part I'd never heard that phrase before AI doesn't care where it goes to school and that's interesting yeah it's true I'm going to think on that yeah uh part of part of calculating the carbon emissions though is also considering the supply chain it's also considering it's going all down the line uh and it requires transparency don't don't move don't move the energy to the data center use the energy where the data center is and then when you're done uh you have a highly compressed model that is essentially the compression of all the energy that was used and we can take that model and bring it back hey can we talk about the next wave so the first wave of course the first wave is accelerated Computing I think I know that she's the interviewer and we're on we're we're we're doing this on her terms but I'm the CEO so so and and and so so no Lauren we we need to come and tell tell this this group about the work that we're doing that that that uh is is really really Court to I I have so many good questions for you I know I know I want to ask you about open source which I think you're going to be talking to Mark about I I want to ask you about I have it import by the way open source is really important it's incredible yeah if not if if not for open source if not for open source uh how would all of these industries and all these companies be able to engage Ai and so look at look at all the companies and all the different Industries they're all using llama llama 2 today today llama 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText: 1 just came out uh people are so excited about it uh We've we've made it possible to democratize Ai and engage every single industry in AI but the thing that I want to say is this the first wave is accelerated Computing reduces energy consumed allows us to deliver continued computational demand without all of the Power continued to grow with it so number one accelerate everything it made it possible for us to have generative AI the generative AI the first wave of it of of course is all the pioneers and we you know we know many of the Pioneers open AI anthropic uh Google uh Microsoft a whole bunch of amazing companies doing this uh uh X is doing this x\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  is doing this amazing companies doing this the next the next wave of AI we we didn't talk about which is uh Enterprise of course one of its applications is customer service and we hope that we can uh give every single organization the ability to create their own AIS and so everybody would be augmented and and have a collaborative AI that could um uh Empower them help them do better work the next wave of AI after that is called physical Ai and this is this is really really quite extraordinary this is where we're going to need three computers one computer to uh create the AI another computer toes simulate the AI both using synthetic gen for synthetic data generation as well as a place where the AI robot the humano robot or the the manipulation robot could go learn how to uh refine its Ai and then of course the third AI is the computer that actually runs the AI so it's a threea three computer problem you know it's a three body problem and so it's incredibly comp it's incredibly complicated and we created three computers to do that and we made a video uh for you for you to enjoy uh understanding this the thing that that we've done here is this uh in every each one of these computers depending on whether you want to use the software stack the algorithms on top or just the Computing infrastructure just a processor for the robot or the functional safety operating system that runs on top of it or the AI and computer vision models that run on top of that or uh just the computer itself any piece is any layer of that stack is open uh for robotics uh developers we created a quick video let's take a look at that is that okay that sounds great the era of physical AI is here physical AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world will embody robots many will be humanoid robots developing these Advanced robots is complex requiring vast amounts of data and workload orchestration across diverse Computing infrastructures Nvidia is working to simplify and accelerate developer workflows with three Computing platforms Nvidia AI Omniverse and Jetson Thor plus generative AI enabled developer tools to accelerate project Groot a general humanoid robot Foundation model Nvidia researchers capture human demonstrations seeing the robot's hands in spatial overlay over the physical world they then use robokos a generative simulation framework integrated into Nvidia Isaac lab to produce a massive number of environments and layouts they increase their data size using mimic gen M which helps them generate large scale synthetic motion data sets based on the small number of original captures they train the Groot model on Nvidia dgx cloud with the combined real and synthetic data sets next they perform software in the loop testing in Isaac Sim and the cloud and Hardware in the loop validation on Jetson Thor before deploying the improved model to the real robots Nvidia osmo robotics Cloud compute orchestration service manages job assignment and scaling across distributed resources throughout the workflow together these Computing platforms are empowering developers worldwide to bring us into the age of physical AI powered humanoid robot you know you know what's amazing Lauren at this conference sigraph is where all of this technology comes together isn't that right everybody researchers of sigraph isn't that right so whether it's computer Graphics or simulation artificial intelligence robotics all of it comes right comes together right here at sigra and that's the reason why I think you should come to sigra from now on me yes I'm happy to I'm thrilled to you I I I took I took uh uh I want 100% of the world's Tech press should come to Cigar we can get behind that just drink a lot of water um uh I went and saw some of the art exhibits last night upstairs in the exhibition effort fantastic just really really cool loved the literal spam Bots whoever created that one go check it out um I was actually listening to the sigraph spotlight podcast before this if folks haven't listened I I really recommend it uh the special projects chair was interviewing a couple of Graphics Legends including David yam yeah and one of the things that David M talked about was archives and this is kind of an existential question for this crowd right but people are creating this really amazing digital media all these these computer Graphics you are accelerating it with your technology it changes so fast now how do you ensure that everything folks are building lives into the future file formats archives accessing all of this work in the future the robots will live on y I have no concern they're going to take over y right Y what about what about the art that people are creating this is this is the existential question but all this well one of the one of the one of the uh that's an excellent question and one of the one of the um the formats that we deeply believe in is open USD open USD is the first format that brings together multimodality from almost almost every single tool and allows it uh to interact to be composed together uh to uh go in and out of these Virtual Worlds and so you could bring in just about any format ideally over time into it uh at this conference we announced that URF the universal robotics data format is now compatible with or can be ingested into into um uh open USD and so one one format after another format uh we're going to bring uh everything into this one common one common language using standards is one of the best ways uh to uh allow content and data to uh be shared be allow everybody to collaborate on it and to lift forever for example HTML without HTML uh it would have been hard for all of these different content from around the world to be accessible to everybody and so in a lot of ways open USD is the HTML of Virtual Worlds and um uh we we've we've been a early promoter of it um uh there's uh amazing companies that have joined and many other companies joining and um my expectation is every single design tool in the world will be able to connect to open USD and once you connect to that virtual world uh you can collaborate with uh anybody with any other Tool uh anywhere and so just like we with HTML you said this content can live forever are you going to build a gensen AI that lives forever absolutely there's a gensen AI in fact just about everything that I've ever said everything that I've ever written and ever done uh will likely be ingested into one of these uh uh generative AI models and I'm I'm I'm hoping that that happens and then uh in the future you'll be able to prompt it and and hopefully something smart gets said so jent and the might to be uh running your earnings calls in the future I hope so that's that's the first thing that has to go that's the first thing it has to go to a bot Jensen thank you so much I think we're probably going to get kicked off stage soon but you'll be back shortly with Mark Zuckerberg and welcome to your first cig ladies and gentlemen Lauren good thank you thank you it's really great shatting again thank you everybody we'll be right back Video games have spectacular graphics, capable of transporting you to incredibly detailed cities, heart-racing battlegrounds, magical worlds, and breathtaking environments\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  While this may look like an old western train station and locomotive from Red Dead Redemption 2, it’s actually composed of 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 1 million vertices assembled into 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 5 million triangles with 976 colors and textures assigned to the various surfaces, all with a virtual sun illuminating the scene below\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: But perhaps the most impressive fact is that these vertices, textures, and lights are entirely composed of ones and zeroes that’s continuously being processed inside your computer’s graphics card or a video game console\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  So then, how does your computer take billions of ones and zeroes and turn it into realistic 3D graphics? Well, let’s jump right in\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: The video game graphics rendering pipeline has three key steps: Vertex Shading, Rasterization, and Fragment Shading\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  While additional steps are used in many modern video games, these three core steps have been used for decades in thousands of video games for both computers and consoles and are still the backbone of the video game graphics algorithm for pretty much every game you play\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: Let’s begin with the first step called vertex shading\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The basic idea in this step is to take all the objects’ geometries and meshes in a 3D space and use the field of view of the camera to calculate where each object falls in a 2D window called the view screen, which is the 2D image that’s sent to the display\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  In this train station scene, there are 1,100 different models and the camera’s field of view sections off what the player sees, reducing the number of objects that need to be rendered to 600\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Let’s focus on the locomotive as an example\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: Although this engine has rounded surfaces and some rather complex shapes, it’s actually assembled from 762 thousand flat triangles using 382 thousand vertices and 9 different materials or colors applied to the surfaces of the triangles\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Conceptually, the entire train is moved as one piece onto the viewscreen, but actually, each of the train’s hundreds of thousands of vertices are moved one at a time\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  So, let’s focus on a single vertex\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The process of moving a vertex, and by extension, the triangles and the train, from a 3D world onto a 2D view screen is done using 3 transformations\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  First moving a vertex from model space to world space, then from world space to camera space, and finally from the perspective field of view onto the view screen\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  To perform this transformation we use the X,Y, and Z coordinates of that vertex in modeling space, then the position, scale, and rotation of the model in world space, and finally the coordinates and rotation of the camera and its field of view\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  We plug all these numbers into different transformation matrices and multiply them together resulting in the X and Y values of the vertex on the view screen as well as a Z value or depth, which we’ll use later to determine object blocking\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  After three vertices of the train are transformed using similar matrix math, we get a single triangle moved onto the view screen\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Then the rest of the 382 thousand vertices of the train and the 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 1 million vertices of all the 600 objects in the camera’s field of view undergo a similar set of transformations, thereby moving all 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 5 million triangles onto a 2D viewscreen\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This is an incredible amount of matrix math, but GPUs in graphics cards and video game consoles are designed to be triangle mesh rendering monsters and thus have evolved over decades to handle millions of triangles every few milliseconds\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  For example, this GPU has 10,000ish cores designed to efficiently execute up to 35 trillion operations of 32-bit multiplication and addition every second, and, by distributing the vertex co-ordinates and transformation data among each of the cores, the GPU can easily render the scene resulting in 120 or more frames a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Now that we have all the vertices moved onto a 2D plane, the next step is to use the 3 vertices of a single triangle and figure out which specific pixels on your display are covered by that triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This process is called rasterization\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: A 4K monitor or TV has a resolution of thirty-eight forty by twenty-one sixty, yielding around 8\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 3 million pixels\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Using the X and Y coordinates of the vertices of a given triangle on the view screen, your GPU calculates where it falls within this massive grid and which of the pixels are covered by that particular triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next, those pixels are shaded using the texture or color assigned to that triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Thus, with rasterization, we turn triangles into fragments which are groups of pixels that come from the same triangle and share the same texture or color\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Then we move on to the next triangle and shade in the pixels that are covered by it and continue to do this for each of the 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 5 million triangles that were previously moved onto the viewscreen\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  By applying the Red Blue and Green color values of each triangle to the appropriate pixels, a 4K image is formed in the frame buffer and sent to the display\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  You’re probably wondering how we account for triangles that overlap or block other triangles\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  For example, the train is blocking the view of much of the train station\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally, the train has hundreds of thousands of triangles on its backside that are sent through the rendering pipeline, but obviously don’t appear in the final image\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Determining which triangles are in front is called the visibility problem and is solved by using a Z-buffer or Depth Buffer\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  A Z-Buffer adds an extra value to each of the 8\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 3 million pixels corresponding to the distance or depth that each pixel is from the camera\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: In the previous step, when we did the vertex transformations, we ended up with X and Y coordinates, but then also got a Z value that corresponds to the distance from the transformed vertex to the camera\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  When a triangle is rasterized, it covers a set of pixels and the Z value or depth of the triangle is compared with the values stored in the Z-Buffer\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  If the triangle’s depth values are lower than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is closer to the camera, then we paint in those pixels using the triangle’s color and re-place the Z-buffer’s values using that triangle’s Z-values\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  However, let’s say a second triangle comes along with Z values that are higher than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is further away\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  We just throw it out and keep the pixels from the triangle that was previously painted with lower Z-values\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Using this method, only the closest triangles to the camera with the lowest Z-values will be displayed on the screen\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  By the way, here’s the image of the Z or Depth buffer, wherein black is close and white is far\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Note that because these triangles are in 3D space, the vertices often have 3 different Z values, and thus each individual pixel of the triangle needs its Z value computed using the vertex coordinates\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This allows intersecting triangles to properly render out their intersections pixel by pixel\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  One issue with rasterization and these pixels is that if the triangle cuts at an angle and passes through the center of the pixel, then the entire pixel is painted with that triangle’s color resulting in jagged and pixelated edges\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: To reduce the appearance of these jagged edges, graphics processors implement a technique called Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  With SSAA, 16 sampling points are distributed across a single pixel, and when a triangle cuts through a pixel, depending on how many of the 16 sampling points the triangle covers, a corresponding fractional shade of that color is applied to the pixel, resulting in faded edges in the image and significantly less noticeable pixelization\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: One thing to remember is that when you’re playing a video game, your character’s camera view as well as the objects in the scene are continuously moving around\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a result, the process and calculations within vertex shading, rasterization, and fragment shading are recalculated for every single frame once every 8\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: 3 milliseconds for a game running at 120 frames a second\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: Let’s move onto the next step which is Fragment Shading\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Now that we have a set of pixels corresponding to each triangle, it’s not enough to simply paint by number to color the pixels\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Rather, to make the scene realistic, we have to account for the direction and strength of the light or illumination, the position of the camera, reflections, and shadows cast by other objects\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Fragment shading is therefore used to shade in each pixel with accurate illumination to make the scene realistic\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a reminder, fragments are groups of pixels formed from a single rasterized triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Let’s see the fragment shader in action\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This train engine is mostly made of black metal, and if we apply the same color to each of its pixel fragments, we get a horribly inaccurate train\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  But once we apply proper shading, such as making the bottom darker and the top lighter, and by adding in specular highlights or shininess where the light bounces off the surface, we get a realistic black metal train\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally, as the sun moves in the sky, the shading on the train reflects the passage of time throughout the day, and, if it’s night, the materials and colors of all the objects are darker and illuminated from the light of the fire\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Even video games such as Super Mario 64 which is almost 30 years old have some simple shading where the colors of surfaces are changed by the lighting and shadows in the scene\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  So, let’s see how fragment shading works\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The basic idea is that if a surface is pointing directly at a light source such as the sun, it’s shaded brighter whereas if a surface is facing perpendicular to, or away from the light, it’s shaded darker\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: In order to calculate a triangle’s shading, there are two key details we need to know\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  First, the direction of the light and second, the direction the triangle’s surface is facing\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Let’s continue to use the locomotive as an example and paint it bright red instead of black\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As you already know, this train is made of 762 thou-sand flat triangles, many of which face in different directions\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The direction that an individual triangle is facing is called its surface normal, which is simply the direction perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, kind of like a flagpole sticking out of the ground\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  To calculate a triangle’s shading, we take the cosine of the angle or theta between the two directions\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The cosine theta value is 1 when the surface is facing the light and when the surface is perpendicular to the light it’s 0\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next, we multiply cosine theta by the intensity of the light and then by the color of the material to get the properly shaded color of that triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This process adjusts the triangles’ RGB values and as a result, we get a range of lightness to darkness of a surface depending on how its individual triangles are facing the light\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  However, if the surface is perpendicular or facing away, we don’t want a cosine theta value of 0 or a negative number because this would result in a pitch-black surface\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Therefore, we set the minimum to 0 and add in an ambient light intensity times the surface color, and adjust this ambient light so that it’s higher in daytime scenes, and closer to 0 at night\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Finally, when there are multiple light sources in a scene, we perform this calculation multiple times with different light directions, and intensities and then add the individual contributions together\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Having more than a few light sources is computationally intense for your GPU, and thus scenes limit the number of individual light sources and sometimes limit the range of influence for the lights so that triangles will ignore distant lights\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  The vector and matrix math used in rendering video game graphics is rather complicated, but luckily there’s a free and easy way to learn it and that’s with Brilliant\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: org\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Brilliant is a multidisciplinary online interactive education platform and is the best way to learn math, computer science, and many other fields of science and engineering\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Thus far we’ve been simplifying the math behind video game graphics considerably\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  For example, vectors are used to find the value of cosine theta between the direction of the light and the surface normal, and the GPU uses the dot product divided by the norm of the two vectors to calculate it\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Additionally, we skipped a lot of detail when it came to 3D shapes and transformations from one coordinate system to another using matrices\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Rather fittingly, Brilliant\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText: org has entire courses on vector calculus,

Topic 3\n\nText:  One key problem with it is that the triangles within an object each have only a single normal, and thus each triangle will share the same color throughout the triangle’s surface\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  This is called flat shading and is rather unrealistic when viewed on curved surfaces such as the body of this steam engine\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText: So, in order to produce smooth shading, instead of using surface normals, we use one normal for each vertex calculated using the average of the normals of the adjacent triangles\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Next, we use a method called barycentric coordinates to produce a smooth gradient of normals across the surface of a triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Visually it’s like mixing 3 different colors across a triangle, but instead we’re using the three vertex normal directions\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  For a given fragment we take the center of each pixel and use the vertex normals and coordinates of the pre-rasterized triangle to calculate the barycentric normal of that particular pixel\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Just like mixing the three colors across a triangle this pixel’s normal will be a proportional mix of the three vertex normals of the triangle\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  As a result, when a set of triangles is used to form a curved surface, each pixel will be part of a gradient of normals resulting in a gradient of angles facing the light with pixel-by-pixel coloring and smooth shad-ing across the surface\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  We want to say that this has been one of the most enjoyable videos to make simply because we love playing video games and seeing the algorithm that makes these incredible graphics has been a joy\nDominant Topic: Topic 2\n\nText:  We spent over 540 hours researching, writing, modelling this scene from RDR2, and animating\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  If you could take a few seconds

covered the core steps for the graphics rendering pipeline, however, there are many more steps and advanced topics\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  For example, you might be wondering where ray tracing and DLSS or deep learning super sampling fits into this pipeline\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Ray tracing is predominately used to create highly detailed scenes with accurate lighting and reflections typically found in TV and movies and a single frame can take dozens of minutes or more to render\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText:  For video games, the primary visibility and shading of the objects are calculated using the graphics rendering pipeline we discussed, but in certain video games ray tracing is used to calculate shadows, reflections, and improved lighting\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  On the other hand, DLSS is an algorithm for taking a low resolution frame and upscaling it to a 4K frame using a convolution neural network\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Therefore DLSS is executed after ray tracing and the graphics pipeline generates a low-resolution frame\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  One interesting note is that the latest generation of GPUs has 3 entirely separate architectures of computational resources or cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  CUDA or Shading cores execute the graphics rendering pipeline\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Ray tracing cores are self-explanatory\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  And then DLSS is run on the Tensor cores\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Therefore, when you’re playing a high-end video game with Ray Tracing and DLSS, your GPU utilizes all of its computational resources at the same time, allowing you to play 4K games and render frames in less than 10 milliseconds each\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Whereas if you were to solely rely on the CUDA or shading cores, then a single frame would take around 50 milliseconds\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  With that in mind, Ray Tracing and DLSS are entirely different topics with their own equally complicated algorithms, and therefore we’re planning separate videos that will explore each of these topics in detail\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  Furthermore, when it comes to video game graphics, there are advanced topics such as Shadows, Reflections, UVs, Normal Maps and more\nDominant Topic: Topic 3\n\nText:  Therefore, we’re considering making an additional video on these advanced topics\nDominant Topic: Topic 1\n\nText:  If you’re interested in such a video let us know in the

about to get started my next my next guest I am so impressed by this person three reasons first reason is there are only a handful of entrepreneurs Founders that started a company that literally touched the lives of billions of people around the world as part of the social fabric invented services and a state-of-the-art Computing company two very few entrepreneurs Founders founded the company and led it to over a trillion dollars of value and three a College Dropout all three things simultaneously ladies and Gentlemen please help me welcome Mark Zuckerberg welcome Mark welcome to your first sigraph right can you believe this one of the pioneers of computing a driver of modern Computing and I had to invite him to sigraph so anyways marks it down it's great to have you here welcome thanks for flying down yeah know this will be fun I he been going for like five hours already or something well yeah sure this is sigraph you know this 90% phds And so so the thing that's really great about sigraph uh as you know this is this is the show of computer Graphics image processing artificial intelligence and Robotics combined and some of the some of the companies that over the years have demonstrated and revealed amazing things here from Disney Pixar Adobe epic games and of course you know Nvidia we've done a lot of work here this year uh we introduced 20 papers at the intersection of artificial intelligence and simulation so we're using artificial intelligence to do um help simulation uh be way larger scale way faster for example uh differentiable physics uh we're using simulation to create uh simulation environments for synthetic data generation for artificial intelligence and so these two areas is are really coming together um really proud of the work that we've done here at meta uh you guys have done amazing AI work I mean one of the things that that that I find amusing is is uh uh when the Press writes about how metas jumped into AI this last last couple of years um as if uh you know the the work that that fair has done uh remember we all use pytorch that comes out of meta uh the uh the work that you do in computer vision the work in uh language models real-time translation uh groundbreaking work I guess my first question for you is you know how do you see how do you see the uh uh the advances of generative AI ad meta today and how do you apply it to either enhance your operations or introduce new capabilities that you're offering yeah so oh a lot to unpack there first of all really happy to be here um you know meta has done a lot of work and has has been at sigra for you know eight years so I mean it's a you know we're noobs compared to to you guys but um you I think it was back in in 2018 you're dressed right but this is my hood I just want it's I mean well thank you for welcoming me to your hood um I think it was back in 2018 we we we showed the some of the early hand tracking work on um for our VR and mixed reality headsets um and I think we've talked a bunch about the progress that we're making on codec avatars the photorealistic um avatars that we want to be able to drive from consumer headsets which we're getting closer and closer to so pretty excited about that and also a lot of the display systems work that we've done so um some of the future prototypes and research for getting the mixed reality headsets to be able to be really thin with like with just um pretty Advanced Optical stacks and and display uh systems the the integrated system I that's that's been stuff that we've typically uh shown here first so um excited to be here uh you know this year not just talking about the metaverse stuff but but also um all the AI pieces which as you said I me we started Fair uh the the AI Research Center um at you know back then it was Facebook now meta uh before we started reality Labs I we've been at this for for a while um the you know all the stuff around gen it's it's an interesting Revolution and and and I think that it's going to it's going to end up making I think all of the different products that we do you know different and and in in interesting ways I mean I I kind of go through you can look at the big product lines that we have already so things like the you know feed and recommendation systems and Instagram and Facebook and we've kind of been on this journey where that's gone from just being about connecting with your friends and the ranking was always important because you even when you were just um you know following friends you know if someone did something really important like your cousin had a baby or something it's like you want that at the top you'd be pretty angry at us if we that was buried somewhere down in your feed um so the ranking was was important but now over the last few years it's gotten to a point where more of that stuff is um is just different public content that's out there the recommendation systems are super important because now instead of just a few hundred or thousand potential candidate posts from friends um there's millions of of of pieces of content and that turns into like a really interesting recommendation problem and with generative AI um I think we're going to quickly move into this Zone where not only is is the majority of the content that you see today on Instagram you know just recommended to you from kind of stuff that's out there in the world that matches your interests whether not you follow the people I think in the future a lot of the stuff is going to be created with these tools too some of that is going to be creators using the tools to create new content some of it I think eventually is going to be content that's either created on the Fly for you um or or or kind of pulled together and synthesize through different things that are out there so that that's just one example of how kind of the core part of what we're doing is just going to evolve and it's been evolving for for 20 years already but I think few people realize that that uh one of the largest Computing systems the world has ever conceived of a recommenders system yeah I mean it's this whole yeah it's this whole different path right it's it's not quite the kind of Genai hotness that people talk about but I think it's it's like as I mean it's all the Transformer architectures and it's a similar thing of just building up more more General models embeding embedding unstructured data into features and yeah I mean one of the big things that just drives quality improvements is you know it used to be that you'd have a different model for each type of content right so a recent example is you know we had you know one model for ranking and recommending reals and another model for ranking and recommending more long form videos and then you know take some product work to basically make it so that the system can display you know anything in line but you know the more you kind of just create more General recommendation models that can span everything it just gets better and better so I mean part of it I think is just like economics and liquidity of content and the broader of a pool that you can pull from you're you're just not having these weird inefficiencies of pulling from different pools but yeah mean as the models get bigger and more General that gets better and better so I I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being you know like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together that actually have different objectives over different time frames right because some of it is just showing you you know what's the interesting content that you're going to be that that you want to see today but some of it is helping you build out your network over the long term right people you may know accounts you might want to follow and these these multimodal models tend to be yeah tend to be much better at recognizing patterns weak signals and such and so one of the things that people people always you know it's so interesting that AI has been so deep in your company you've been building GPU infrastructure running these large recommender systems for a long time now you're now you're a little slow on it actually getting to gpus yeah I was trying to be nice I know well you know too nice I was trying to be nice you know my gu when I was backstage before I came on here you were talking about like owning your mistakes or something right so you don't have to volunteer it out of the blue I I think this one has been well tried it's like I got breaked over the but as soon as you got into it as soon as you got into it you got into it strong let's just put it there you go there you go now now now the thing that's really cool about about generative AI is is these days when I use WhatsApp I feel like I'm collaborating with what'sapp I love imagine I'm sitting you're typing and it's generating the images as I'm going I go back and I change my words it's generating other images yeah you know and and so the one that that o old Chinese guy uh enjoying a glass of whiskey at sundown with three dogs golden retriever golden doodle and a bernes mountain dog and it generates you know a pretty good looking pict yeah yeah we're we're getting there every month getting better and then now you could actually load my picture in there actually be me yeah that's as of last week yeah yeah super excited about that now imagine me I know I'm spending a lot of time with my daughters imagining them as mermaids and things over the last um over the last week it's been it's been a lot of fun but yeah I mean that's that's the other half of it I mean the a lot of the Gen stuff is going to on the one hand it's I think going to just be this big upgrade for all of the workflows and products that we've had for a long time but on the other hand there's going to be all these completely new things things that can now get created So Meta AI um you know the idea of having you know just an an AI assistant that can help you with different tasks and um in in our world is going to be you know very creatively oriented like you're saying but um but I mean they're very general so I you don't need to just constrain it to that it'll be able to answer any question um over time I think you know when we move from like the Llama 3 class of models to llama 4 and Beyond it's um it's going to I think feel less like a chat box where it's like you you give it a a a prompt and it just responds then you give it a prompt and it responds and it's just like back and forth I think it's going to pretty quickly evolve to you give it an intent and it actually can go away on multiple time frames and I mean it probably should acknowledge that you gave it an intent up front but I mean you know some of the stuff I think will end up you know it'll spin up you know compute jobs that take you know weeks or months or something then just come back to you when like something happens in the world and I think that that's going to be really powerful so I mean today's AI as you as you know is kind of turnbas you say something it says something back to you um but obviously when we think when we're given a mission or we're giving a problem you know we we'll contemplate multiple options or maybe we come up with a you know a tree of options a decision tree and we walk down to the decision tree simulating in our mind you know what are the different outcomes of each decision that we could potentially make and so we we're doing planning and so in the the future AIS will will kind of do the same one of the things that that I was super excited about when you talked about your vision of Creator AI I just think that's that's a home run idea frankly tell everybody about the Creator Ai and AI Studio that's going to enable you to do that yeah so so we actually I mean this is something that we're we're you know we've talked about it a bit but we're rolling it out a lot wider today um you know a lot of our vision is that I don't think that there's just going to be like one AI model right I mean this is something that some of the other companies in the industry they're like you know it's like they're building like one Central agent and and yeah we we'll have the metai assistant that you can use but a lot of our vision is that we want to empower all the people who use our products to basically create agents for themselves whether that's you know all the many many millions of creators that are on the platform or you know hundreds of millions of small businesses um we eventually want to just be able to pull in all your content and very quickly stand up a business agent and um be able to interact with your customers and you know do sales and customer support and all that so the one that we're that we're just starting to roll out more now is um we call it AI studio and it basically is um a set of tools that eventually is going to make it so that every Creator can build sort of an AI version of themselves um as as sort of an an agent or an assistant that that their Community can interact with there's kind of a fundamental issue here where there's there's just not enough hours in the day right it's like if you're if you're a Creator you want to engage more with your community um but you you you're constrained on time and similarly your community wants to engage with you uh but it's tough I mean there's there's just there's a limited time to do that so the next best thing is is allowing people to basically create these artifacts right it's um it's sort of it's an agent but it's you train it to kind of on on your material um to represent you in the way that you want I think it it's it's a very kind of creative Endeavor almost like a like a piece of of art or content that you're putting out there and know it's it's going to be very clear that it's not engaging with the Creator themselves but I think it'll be another interesting way just like how creators put out content on on these um social systems to be able to have agents that do that similarly I think that there's going to be a thing where people basically create their own agents for all different kinds of uses some will be sort of customized utility things that they're trying to get done that they want to kind of fine-tune and and train an agent for some of will be entertainment and some of the things that people create are just funny you know and just kind of silly in different ways or or kind of have a funny attitude about things that um you know we probably couldn't we probably wouldn't build into meta AI as an assistant but but I think people um people are are kind of pretty interested to see um and interact with and then one of the interesting use cases that we're seeing is people kind of using these agents for support um this was one thing that that was a little bit surp surprising to me is one of the top use cases for meta AI already is people basically using it to roleplay difficult social situations that they're going to be in so whether it's a professional situation it's like all right I want to ask my manager like how do I get a promotion or raise or I'm having this fight with my friend or I'm having this difficult situation with my girlfriend like how like how can this conversation go and basically having a like a completely judgment free zone where you can basically roleplay that and see how how how the conversation will go and and get feedback on it um but a lot of people they don't just want to interact with the same kind of you know agent whether it's met AI or chat GPT or whatever it is that everyone else is using they want to kind of create their own thing so that's that's roughly where we're going with AI Studio but it's all part of this bigger I I guess view that we have that there shouldn't just be kind of one big AI that people interact with we we we just think that the world will be better and more if there's a diversity of these different things I just think it's so cool that if you're an artist and you have a style you could take your style all of your body of work you could fine-tune yeah one of your models yeah and now this becomes an AI model that you can come and you could prompt it you could ask me to uh you know create something along the lines of the art style that I have and you might even give me a piece of art as a make a drawing a sketch as an inspiration and I can generate something for you and it's and you come to my come to my uh uh you know come to my bot for that come to my AI for that it could be it could be a uh every single uh every single restaurant every single website will probably in the future have these AIS yeah I mean I I kind of think that in the future just like every business has you know an email address and a website and a social media account or several I think in the future every business is going to have an AI agent that interfaces with their customers and some of these things I think have been pretty hard to do historically like um if you think about any company it's like you probably have customer support is just a separate organization from sales and that's not really how you'd want it to work as CEO it's just that okay they're kind of different skills you're building up these I'm your customer support just a what's up I'm your yeah well apparently I am yeah I mean whenever Mark needs something as CEO I can't tell whether it's chatbot or it's Mark but he it's just my chatbot just asking you um no well I guess that's kind of yeah when you're CEO you have to do all the stuff but but I mean then when you build the abstraction into your organization a lot of times like the you know in general the organizations are separate because they're kind of optimized for different things but I think like the platonic ideal of this would be that it's kind of one thing right as a you know as a customer you don't really care you know you don't want to like have a different route when you're trying to buy something versus if you're having an issue with something that you bought you just want to have a place that you can go and get your questions answered and be able to um engage with the business in different ways and I think that that applies for creators too I think that the the kind of personal consumer side of this is all that engagement with your customers especially if their complaints is going to make your company better yeah totally right the fact that it's all engaging with this AI is going to capture the the uh the institutional knowledge and how to and all of that can go into analytics which improves the AI and so on so forth yeah yeah so the business version of this is um that I think has a little more integration and we're still in in a pretty early Alpha that but the AI Studio making it so people can kind of create their ugc agents and and different things and getting started on this flywheel of having creators create them I'm I'm pretty excited about that and so can I can I use AI Studio to fine-tune with my images my collection of images yeah you're yeah we're going to get there okay and then I could could I give it load it all the things that I've written so that use it use it as my rag yeah yeah yeah basically okay and then every time I come back to it it loads up the it's memory again so it remembers where it left off last time yep and we carry on our conversation as as if nothing ever happened yeah and and and look I mean like any product it'll get better over time the tools for training it will get better it's not just about what you want it to say I mean I think generally creators and businesses have topics that they want to stay away from too right so just getting better at all this stuff um you know I think the platonic version of this is not just text right you you almost want to just be able to and this is sort of an intersection with some of the codec Avatar work that we're doing over time you want to basically be able to have almost like a video chat with with the um with the with the agent and I think we'll get there over time I don't think that this stuff is that far off but the um the flywheel is spinning really quickly so it's it's it's exciting um there is a lot of new stuff to build and I I think even if the progress on the foundation models kind of stopped now which I don't think it will I think we'd have like five years of product Innovation for the industry to basically figure out how to most effective use all the stuff that's gotten built so far but I actually just think the the kind of foundation models and the progress on the fundamental research is accelerating so um so that it's a it's a pretty wild time your vision of it's all it's all um you know you kind of made this happen so why thank you in the last conversation I I thank you yeah you know that you know we're CEOs we're we're delicate flowers we need a lot of back yeah we're we're pretty grizzled at this point I think we're we're the two kind of longest standing Founders in the industry right it's I mean it's true it's true it's true I just and your hair has gotten gray mine has just gotten longer mine's gotten gray yours gotten curly what's up it was always curly that's why I kept it short okay yeah I just if if I known it was going to take so long to succeed you never would have started no I would have dropped out of college just like you get a head start well that's a that's a good difference between our personalities I I think that these things you got a 12 year Head Start that's pretty good that's pretty good you know you're doing pretty well uh I'm gon to I'm going to be able to carry on let me just put it that way yes so so um I the the thing that I love about about um your vision of that everybody can have an AI that every business can have an AI in our company I want every engineer and every software developer to have an AI yeah and um or many AIS uh the thing that's that that I love about your vision is you also believe that everybody and every company should be able to make their own AI so you actually open sourced uh when you open source llama I thought that was great llama 2\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 1 by the way I I thought llama 2 was probably the biggest event in AI last year and the reason for that I I thought it was the h100 but you know it's a it's a chicken or the egg question that's a chicken or the egg yeah which came first the h100 no well llama 2 was was actually not the h100 yeah it was a100 yeah thank you and so so um uh but but the reason why I said was the biggest event was because when that came out it activated every company every Enterprise and every industry all of a sudden every Healthcare company was building AIS every company was building AI every large company small companies startups was were building AIS it made it possible for every researcher to be able to re-engage AI again because they have a starting point to do something with um and uh and then now uh 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 1 is out and the excitement just so you know uh you know we work together to to uh uh deploy uh 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 1 we're taking it out to the world's Enterprise and the excitement is just off the charts and and I I think it's going to enable all kinds of applications but tell tell me about your your open- Source philosophy where did I come from from and you know you open source pytorch yeah and that it is now the framework by which AI is done and and uh now you've open source llama 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 1 or llama uh there's a whole ecosystem built around it and so I think it's horrific but where did that all come from yeah so there's there's a bunch of history on on a lot of this I mean we've done a lot of Open Source work over time um I think part of it you know just bluntly is you know we got started after some of the other tech companies right in building out stuff like the distributed computing infrastructure and and the data centers and you know because of that by the time that we built that stuff it wasn't a competitive Advantage so we're like all right we might as well make this open and then we'll benefit from the from the ecosystem around that so we we had a bunch of projects like that I think the biggest one was probably open compute where we took our server designs the network designs and eventually the data center designs and published all of that and by having that become somewhat of an industry standard um all the supply chains basically got or organized around it which had this benefit of saving money for everyone so by making it public um and open we basically have saved billions of dollars from doing that work open compute was also what made it possible for NVIDIA hgx is that we design for one data center all a sudden Works in yeah Works in every data center awesome um so so we so that was an awesome experience and then you we've done it with a bunch of our kind of infrastructure tools things like react pie torch um so I'd say by the time that llama came around we were sort of positively predisposed towards doing this um for for AI models specifically I guess there's a few ways that I look at this I mean one is you know it's been really fun building stuff over the last 20 years at the company um one of the things that that has been sort of the most difficult has been kind of having to navigate the fact that we ship our apps through through our competitors mobile platforms so in the one hand the mobile platforms have been this huge Boon to the industry that's been awesome um on the other hand having to deliver your products through your competitors um is challenging right and and I also you know I grew up in a time where you know the first version of Facebook was on the web and that was open and then you know as it transitioned to mobile you know the plus side of that was you know now everyone has a computer in their pocket so that's great the downside is okay we're a lot more restricted in what we can do so when you look at these generation of computing there's this big recency bias where everyone just looks at mobile and thinks okay because the closed ecosystem because Apple basically won and set the the terms of that and like yeah I know that there's more Android phones out there technically but like apple basically has the whole Market um and and and like all the profits and and basically Android is kind of following Apple in terms of the development of it so I think Apple pretty clearly won this generation but it's not always like that right I me if you go back a generation um you Apple was doing their their kind of closed thing um but Microsoft which was you know it's it obviously isn't like this perfectly open company but you know compared to to to Apple with Windows running on all the different oems and different software uh and different different Hardware um was a much more open ecosystem and Windows Windows was the leading ecosystem it it um you know it it basically in the kind of PC generation of things the open ecosystem one and I am kind of hopeful that in the next generation of computing we're going to return to a Zone where the open ecosystem wins and is the leading one again there will always be a closed one and an open one I think that there's reasons to do both there are benefits to both I'm not like a zealot on this I mean we do closed Source stuff and not everything that we that we publish is open um but I think in general for the Computing platforms that the whole industry is building on there's a lot of value for that if the software especially is open so that's really shaped My Philosophy on this and um for both AI with llama and with the work that we're doing in AR and VR where we're basically making the Horizon OS that we're building for mixed reality um an an open operating system in the sense of of kind of what Android or or Windows was and and basically making it so that um like we're going to be able to work with lots of different Hardware companies to make all different kinds of of devices we basically just want to return the ecosystem to that level where that that's going to be the open one and and I I I'm pretty optimistic that the Next Generation the open ones are going to win for for us specifically um you know I just want to make sure that we have access to I mean this is sort of selfish but I mean it's you know after building this company for a while um one of my things for the next 10 or 15 years is like I just want to make sure that we can build the fundamental technology that we're going to be building social experiences on because there have just been too many things that I've tried to build and then have just been told nah you can't really Build That by the platform provider that at some level I'm just like nah that for the next Generation Um like we're going to go build like all all the way down and and make sure that that we there goes our broadcast opportunity yeah no sorry um sorry um like beep yeah you know we're doing okay for like 20 minutes but give me give me talking about closed platforms and I get angry um so um hey look it it is great I think it's a great world where where uh where there are people who are dedicated uh to build the best possible AI however they build it and they make they they offer it to the World um you know as a service and then but if you want to build your own AI you could still also build your own AI so the ability totally to right to use an AI you know there's a lot of stuff I prefer not to make this jacket myself I prefer to have this Jack made for me you know what I'm saying yeah yeah but so the fact that so the fact that leather could be open source is not a useful concept for me but but I I think the the idea that you could you could have great Services incredible Services as well as open Service open ability then then we basically have the entire Spectrum but the the thing that's that that that you did with 3\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nText: 1 that was really great was you have 405b you have 70b you have 8B you could you could use it for synthetic data generation use the larger models to essentially teach the smaller models and although the larger models will be more General um it it's less brittle uh you could you could still build a smaller model that fits in you know whatever operating domain or operating cost that you would like to have uh you you uh uh met a guard I think llama guard llama guard for Guard railing fantastic um and so now and the way that that you built the model uh it's built in a transparent way it's uh has you dedicated you've got a world class safety team World Class ethics team uh you could build it in such a way that everybody knows it's built properly and so I really love that part of it yeah and I mean just to finish the thought from from before uh before I got I got Sidetrack there for detour um you know I do think there's this alignment where I we're building it because we want the thing to exist and we want to knock it cut off from some closed model right and um but it this isn't just like a piece of software that you can build it's you know you need an ecosystem around it and so it's it's almost like it it kind of almost wouldn't even work that well if we didn't open source it right it's it's not we're not doing this because we're kind of altruistic people um even though I I I think that this is going to be helpful for the ecosystem and we're doing it because we think that this is going to make the thing that we're building the best by by kind of having a robust ecosystem around how many people contributed to pytorch ecosystem yeah totally mountains of engineering yeah right yeah yeah Nvidia alone we probably have a couple of hundred people just dedicated to making P torch better and scalable and you know more performant and so on so forth yeah and it's it's also just when something becomes something of an industry standard other folks do work around it right so like all of the silicon and the systems will end up being optimized to run this thing really well which will benefit everyone but it will also work well with the system that we're building and that's I I think just one example of how this ends up being um just being really effective so yeah I mean I I think that the open source strategy is going to be is going to be a good one as a business strategy I I think people still don't quite get we we love it so much we built an ecosystem around it we built this thing called on this yeah yeah yeah you guys have been awesome on this I mean every time we're shipping something you guys are the first to to release this and and optimize it and make it work and so I mean I I appreciate that but what can what can I say we have good Engineers you know and so and and well you always just jump on the quickly too so well I you know I'm a I'm a senior citizen but I'm agile you know that's what CEOs have to do um and I recognize an important thing I recognize an important thing and and I I think that llama is genuinely important we built this concept to call an AI Factory uh AI Foundry around it uh so that we can help everybody build take you know a lot of people they they they have a desire to um uh uh build Ai and it's very important for them to own the AI because once they put put that into their their flywheel their data flywheel that's how their company's institutional knowledge is encoded and embedded into an an AI so they can't afford to have the AI flywheel the data flywheel that experienced flywheel somewhere else so and and so open source allows them to do that but they they don't really know how to turn this whole thing into an AI and so we created this thing called an AI Foundry we provide the tooling we provide the expertise uh llama uh technology uh we have the ability to help them uh turn this whole thing uh into an AI service and and then when when we're done with that uh they take it they own it we the output of it's what we call a Nim and this Nim this this neurom micro Nvidia inference micros Service uh they just download it they take it and they run it anywhere they like including on Prem and we have a whole ecosystem of Partners uh from oems that can run the NIMS to uh gsis like Accenture that that we've trained and work with to create llama based Nims and and uh and pipelines and and now we're we're off helping Enterprises all over the world do this I mean it's really quite an exciting thing it's really all triggered off of uh the Llama open sourcing yeah I think especially the ability to help people distill their own models from the big model is going to be a really valuable new thing because I I there's this you just like we talked about on the product side how at least I don't think that there's going to be like one major AI agent that everyone talks to it's at the same level I don't think that there's going to NE necessarily be one model that everyone uses we have a chip AI chip design AI we have a software coding Ai and our software coding AI understands uh USD because we code in USD for for Omniverse stuff um uh we have a software AI that understands verog our ver log um we have uh we have software AI that understands our bugs database and knows how to help us triage bugs and sends it to the right engineers and so each one of these AIS are fine-tuned off of llama and and so we find tune them we guardrail them you know if we if we have a if we have a an AI design for for uh for chip design uh we're not interested in asking it about politics you know and religion and things like that so we guardrail it and so so I think I think every company will essentially have for every single function that they have uh they will likely have AIS that are built for that and they need help to do that yeah I mean I think it's one of the big questions is going to be in the future to what extent are people just using the kind of the bigger more sophisticated models versus just training their own models for the uses that they have and at least I would bet that they are going to be just a a just vast proliferation of different models people we use the largest ones and the reason for that is because our Engineers are their times are so valuable and so we get uh right now we're getting 405b uh optimized for performance and as you know 405b doesn't fit in any GPU no matter how big and so that's why the MV link performance perance is so important we have this every one of our gpus connected by this nonblocking switch called MV link switch and um in the hgx for example there are two of those switches and we make it possible for all these all these gpus to work and and um uh run the 405 BS really performant the reason why we do it is because the the engineers times are so valuable to us you know we want to use the best possible model the fact that it's cost effective by a few pennies who cares and so we we we just want to make sure that the best qu quity of result is presented to them yeah well I mean the 405 I think is about half the cost to inference of the GPT 40 model so I mean at that level it's already I mean it's it's pretty good but yeah I mean I think people are doing stuff on devices or want smaller models they're just going to distill it down so that's like a whole different set of services that AI is running and let's let's pretend for a second that we're hiring that AI that AI for chip design is probably $10 an hour MH you're you're using you know and and uh uh um if you're using it constantly and you're sharing that AI across a whole bunch of Engineers so each engineer probably has an AI that's sitting sitting with them that cost you know doesn't cost very much and we pay the engineers a lot of money and so so to us a few dollars an hour uh amplifies the capabilities of somebody that's really valuable yeah yeah I mean you don't need to convince me if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't hired an AI do it right away that's all we're saying and so so um I I let's let's talk about let's talk about um the next the next wave um you know one of the things that I really love about the work that you guys do computer vision um uh one of the models that we use a lot internally uh is segment everything and um uh you know that that we're now train tring AI models on video so that we can understand the world model our use case our use cases for Robotics and and uh industrial industrial uh digitalization and um uh connecting these AI models into Omniverse so that we can we can um uh model and represent the physical world better uh have robots that operate in these Omniverse worlds better uh your your application uh uh the the Rayband metag glass um your vision for for bringing AI into the virtual world uh is really interesting tell us about that yeah well okay a lot to unpack in there um the segment anything model that that you're talking about we're actually presenting I think the next version of that here at at sigraph segment anything two um and it is it now works it's faster it works with um oh here we go um it works in video now as well I think the these are actually cattle from my Ranch in Kawaii um but by the way these are what they're called delicious delicious marks cows um there you go yeah another next time we do so Mark Mark came up to my house and we made Philly cheese steak together next time you're bringing the cow you did I was more of a sue Chef it was really good it was really good that suf comment okay listen and then at the end of the night though you were like hey so you you you ate enough right and I was like I don't know I could eat another one you're like really you know usually when you say something like you were being I was definitely like yeah we're making more we're making more she did you get enough to eat usually your guest says oh yeah that I'm fine make me another cheese steak Jensen so just to let you know how OCD he is so I turn around I'm I'm prepping the the the cheese steak and said Mark cut the tomatoes and so so Mark I handed him a knife yeah I'm I'm a Precision cutter and so he cuts he cuts the uh the tomatoes every single one of them are perfectly to the exact millimeter but the really interesting thing is I was expecting all the tomatoes to be sliced and kind of stacked up kind of like a a deck of cards and uh but when I turned around he said he needed another another plate and the reason for that was because all of the tomatoes he cut none of them touched each other once he separates one slice of tomato from The Other Tomato they shall not touch again yeah look man if you wanted them to touch you needed to tell me that right why I'm just the Sue Chef okay that's why he needs an AI that doesn't judge yeah it's like so this is super cool okay so it's recognizing the cows track it's recognizing tracking the cows yeah yeah so it's um a lot of fun effects will be able to be made with this and because it'll be open a lot of more serious applications across the industry too so I mean scientists use this stuff to you know study um like coral reefs and natural habitats and um and kind of evolution of Landscapes and things like that but I mean it's uh being able to do this in video and having it be zero shot and be able to kind of interact with it and tell it what you want to track is um it's it's it's pretty cool research so for example the reason why we use it uh for example you have a warehouse and it's got a whole bunch of cameras and the warehouse uh AI uh is watching everything that's going on and let's say a uh you know a stack of Boxes Fell uh or somebody spilled water on the ground um or you know what whatever accident is about to happen the AI recognizes it generates the text send it to somebody and you know uh you know help will come along the way and so that's one way of using it uh instead of recording everything if there's an accident and started recording every nanc a video and then going back and re retrieve that moment it just it just records the important stuff because it knows what it's looking at and so so having a vi video understanding model a video language model is really really powerful for all all these these interesting applications now what else what else are you guys going to work on Beyond uh Ray talk talk to me about yeah so there's all the smart glasses right so I think when we think about the next Computing platform you know we kind of break it down into mixed reality the headsets and the smart glasses and the smart glasses I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around that and wearing it because it's you know pretty much everyone who's wearing a pair of glasses today will end up that'll get upgraded to smart glasses and that's like more than a billion people in the world so that's going to be a pretty big thing um the VMR headsets I think some people find it interesting for gaming or different uses some don't yet my view is that they're going to be both in world I think the smart glasses are going to be sort of the mobile phone kind of always on version of the next Computing platform and the mixed reality headsets are going to be more like your workstation or your game console where when you're sitting down for a more immersive session and you want access to more compute I mean look I mean the glasses are just very small form factor um there going to be a lot of constraints on that just like you can't do the same level of computing on a phone came at exactly the time when all of these breakthroughs in generative AI happened yeah so we we basically for smart classes we've been we've been going at the problem from two different directions on the one hand we've been building what we think is sort of the technology that you need for the kind of Ideal holographic AR glasses and we're doing all the custom silicon work all the custom display stack work like all the stuff that you would need to do to make that work and they're glasses right it's not a headset it's not like a VR or Mr headset they look like glasses but um they're still quite a bit far off from the glasses that you're wearing now I mean those are very thin but um but even even the rayb bands that we that we make you couldn't quite fit all the tech that you need to into that yet for kind of full holographic AR though we're getting close and over the next few years I think we'll we'll basically get closer it'll still be pretty expensive but but I think that'll start to be a product um the other angle that we've come at this is let's start with good-look glasses by partnering with the Best glasses maker in the world es luoda they basically make they have all all the big brands that you use um you know with it's rayan or Oakley or Oliver pees or just like a handful of others kind of all L luoda the Nvidia of glasses um I I think that you know it's um I think they would probably like that analogy but um I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't at this point um but I so we've been working with them on on the rayb bands we're on the second generation and the goal there has been okay let's constrain the form factor to just something that looks great great idea and within that let's put in as much technology as we can understanding that we're not going to get to the kind of ideal of what we want to fit into it technically but it'll it'll but at the end it'll be like great looking glasses and we at this point we have we have camera sensors so you can you can take photos and videos you can actually live stream to Instagram you can take video calls on WhatsApp and stream to the other person um you know what you're seeing um you can I mean it has it has a microphone and speaker so I mean the speaker is actually really good it's open ear so you a lot of people find it more comfortable than than earbuds um you can listen to music and it's just like this private experience that's pretty neat people love that you take phone calls on it um but then it just turned out that that sensor package was exactly what you needed to be able to talk to AI too yeah so that was sort of an accident if you'd asked me five years ago were we gonna get holographic AR before AI I would have said yeah probably right I mean it's it just seems like kind of the graphics progression and the display progression on all the virtual and mixed reality stuff and building up the new display stack we were just making continual progress towards that that's right and then this breakthrough happened with llms and it turned out that we have sort of really high quality AI now and getting better at a really fast rate before you have holographic AR so it's sort of this inversion that that I didn't really expect I mean we're we're fortunately well positioned because we were working on all these different products but I think what you're going to end up with is um just a whole series of different potential glasses products at different price points with different levels of technology in them so I kind of think um based on what we're seeing now with the Rayband metas I I would guess that display AI glasses MH at like a $300 price point are going to be a really big product that like tens of millions of people or hundreds of millions of people eventually are going to have um and you're going to have super interactive AI that you're talking to you have visual you have visual language understanding that you just showed you have realtime translation you could talk to me in one language I hear it in another language yeah then the display is obviously going to be great too but it's going to add a little bit of weight to the glasses and it's going to make them more expensive so I think for there will be a lot of people who want the kind of full holographic display but there are also going to be a lot of people for whom um you know they they want something that eventually is going to be like really thin glasses and well for industrial applications and for some work applications we need that we need I think for Consumer stuff too you think so yeah I mean I I think you know it's I was thinking about this a lot during the you know during covid when when everyone kind of went remote for a bit it's like you're spending all this time on Zoom it's like okay this is like it's great that we have this but um but in the future we're like not that many years away from being able to have a virtual meeting where like you know it's like I'm not here physically it's just my hologram and like it just feels like we're there and we're physically present we can work on something and collaborate on something together but I think this is going to be especially important with AI I could live with with a a device that that I'm not wearing all the time oh yeah but I think we're going to get to the point where it actually is I could it'll be I mean there's with within glasses there's like thinner frames and there's thicker frames and there's like all these Styles but um so I don't I think we're we're a while away from having full holographic glasses in the form factor of your glasses but I think having it in a pair of stylish kind of chunkier framed glasses is not that far off these sunglasses are the face size these days I could see that yeah and and you know what that's that's a very helpful style track exactly that's a very helpful whoever you know it's like like I'm I'm trying to you know TR make my way into becoming like a style influencer so I can like influence this before um you know before the glasses come to the market but you know well I can see you attempting it how's your style influencing working out for you you know it's early yeah it's um it's early it's early um but I don't know I feel like if if if a big part of the future of the business is going to be building um kind of stylish glasses that people wear um this is something I should probably start paying a little more attention to right then we're going to have to retire the version of me that we're the same thing every day but I mean that's the thing about glasses too I I think it's um you know it's unlike you know even the watch or or phones like people really do not want to all look the same right and and it's like so I do think that it's you know it's it's a it's a platform that I think is going to lend itself going back to the theme that we talked about before towards being an open ecosystem because I think the diversity of form factors that people and styles that people are going to demand is going to be immense um it's not like everyone is not going to want to put like the one kind of pair of glasses that you know whoever else designs like that's not I don't think that's going to fly for this yeah I think that's right well Mark it's sort of incredible that we're living through a time where where the entire Computing stack is re being reinvented how we think about software you know what what Andre calls software one and software 2 and now we're basically in software 3 now the way we compute um from general purpose Computing to these generative neural network processing way of doing Computing um the capabilities the applications we could develop now are Unthinkable in the past and and this technology generative AI uh I don't remember another technology that that in such a fast rate influenced consumers Enterprise Industries and science yeah and to be able to to cut across cut across um all these different fields of science from from climate Tech to U biotech um uh to uh physical sciences uh in every single field that we're encountered uh generative AI is is right at the middle of that uh fundamental transition and and it's and and in addition to that uh the things that you're talking about generative AI is going to make a a profound impact in society you know the products that we're making and one of the things that I'm s super excited about and somebody asked me earlier is there going to be a you know gents and AI um well that's exactly the creative AI you were talking about you know where we just build our own AIS and I I load it up with all of the things that I've written and and I I fine-tune it with with uh uh with the way I answer questions and and uh and hopefully hopefully over time the accumulation of use and you know becomes a really really great assistant and companion for for uh uh for a whole lot of people who just wants to you know ask questions or um bounce ideas off of and and it'll be the version of Jensen that as as you were saying earlier that's that's not judgmental you're not afraid of being judged and so you could come and interact with it all the time but but I I just think I think that th those are real really incredible things and and you know we we write we write a lot of things all the time and and how incredible is it just to give it you know three or four topics these are the basic themes of what I want to write about and write it in my voice and just use that as a starting point so there's there's just so many things that we can do now uh it it's really terrific working with you and uh uh I I know that I know that uh it's not easy building a company and you pivoted yours from desktop to mobile to VR to AI all these devices uh it's really really really extraordinary to watch and Nvidia pivoted many times ourselves and I know exactly how hard it is doing that and uh um you know both of us have have gotone kicked in our teeth a lot plenty over the years but that's that's what it takes to to uh uh to want to be a Pioneer and and innovate so it's really great watching you well and likewise I mean it's like it's I'm not sure if it's a pivot if you keep doing the thing you were doing before but but is as well but it's but you add to it I mean there's more chapters to all the to to all this and I think the same thing for it's been fun watching I me the journey that you guys have been on I mean just and you went we went through this period where everyone was like nah everything is going to kind of move to these devices and you know just going to get super kind of cheap compute and and you guys just kept on plugging away at this and it's like no like actually you're going to want these big systems that can that can paralyze we went the other way yeah no and it's I mean yeah we went and instead of building smaller and smaller devices we make computers as size unfashionable for a while a little unfashionable super unfashionable yeah yeah but now now it's cool and and instead of in you know we started building a graphics chip a GPU and and now when you when uh when you're deploying a GPU you still call it Hopper h100 but so you guys know when when when Zuck calls it h100 his data center of h100s there's like I think you're coming up on 600,000 and and they're we're good customers that's how you get the Jensen Q&A at sigraph wow hang on that I was getting the Mark Zuckerberg Q&A you were my guest and I wanted to make sure that that you just called me one day and you're like hey yeah you know in like a couple of weeks we're doing this thing at sigar I'm like yeah I don't think I'm doing anything that day to Denver it sounds fun exactly I'm not doing anything that afternoon you showed up and and uh but but the thing the thing is just incredible these these systems that you guys build uh they're they giant systems incredibly hard to orchestrate incredibly hard to to run and you know you said that that you got into the GPU uh Journey later than than most but you're operating larger than just about anybody and it's it's incredible to watch and congratulations on everything that you've done and uh you you are quite the style icon now check check out this guy huh early stage working on it working on it it's a ladies and gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg thank you hang on hang on well um you know you know um so turns out the last time that we got together after dinner Mark Mark and I I where Jersey swap Jersey Swap and and uh we took a picture and and turned in it turned into something viral and um and now I thought that he he has no trouble wearing my jacket I don't know is that my look I don't think I can should be it should be is that right yeah I actually I um I made one for you you did you did yeah that one's marks I mean hey let's see we got we got a box back here it's black and leather and sheering oh I didn't make this I just ordered it online hang on a second hang on a second it's a little chilly in here I think I'll try this on I think this is my goodness I mean this is that's a it's a Vibe you just need is this me we'll be pretty I mean get this guy a chain all right next time I see you I'm bring you a gold chain so fair is fair so I let you know I I was telling everybody that Lori bought me a new jacket to celebrate this year's sigraph sigraph is is a big thing in our company as you could imagine RTX was launched here amazing things were launched here and this is a brand new jacket it's literally 2 hours old wow and so I think we had a jersey swap again all right well this one's yours I mean this is worth more cuz it's used let's see I don't know I don't I think I think Mark is pretty buff he's the guy's pretty jacked I mean you too man all right all right everybody gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg have a great Sig oh\n\nDominant Topic: Topic 4\n\nTopic Distribution:\nTopic 4: 391 documents\nTopic

We'll begin with GeForce RTXand then cover robotics. Let's get started. Welcome to our world. Where every play, every moment, and every detail matters. From creating new worlds, to epic solo adventures and chaotic multiplayer showdowns, we take you beyond the edge. And by uniting fearless innovation with the power of AI, you’re charged with superpowers, making every move momentous, and bringing every concept to life. RTX, it’s on. NVIDIA has led PC gaming and content creationthrough three decades of technology breakthroughs and performance gains of 10 million X. There are now over 200 million gamersand creators worldwide who count on GeForcepowered desktops and laptops. Today, NVIDIA is at the centerof the latest technology transformation: Generative AI. Gen AI presents an opportunityfar larger than the Internet. It will change how we interact with games. It will speed up creative workflowsand will give everyone a co-pilot to make us all more productive. NVIDIA’s journey in AI began in 2006. We launched the GeForce 8800 GTX. Designed to play the most challenging video games, it proved it could certainly run Crysis. The 8800 architecture alsointroduced CUDA cores, allowing researchers and developers everywhere to program the GPU for non-graphical applications. In 2012, a team of researchersfrom the University of Toronto made an incredible discovery. The GeForce GTX 580 GPU, best known for running games like Call of Duty,could be programmed with CUDA to run a convolutional neural network,an early innovation in deep learning. In fact, the GTX 580 crushedthe record in the famed ImageNet Image Recognition contest, and the era of GPU-acceleratedDeep Learning had begun. NVIDIA launched RTX in 2018and set in motion a giant leap in graphics—real time ray tracing. Ten years in the making! It combined RT cores used to process rays,with tensor cores, used for AI-powered Deep LearningSuper Sampling, or DLSS. The ray-traced Star WarsReflections experience, which previously required four NVIDIA V100data center GPUs at a price tag of $60,000, was now possibleon a single GeForce RTX GPU. We continued to invest in ray tracing and AI. From its launch in 2018, RTX AI performance has increased 10X to 1300 Tera-ops, or TOPs. Now with DLSS 3.5, seven out of every eight pixels aregenerated by AI, accelerating full ray tracing by up to 4Xwith better image quality. Last year, AI made a dramatic leapto the mainstream. ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion inspiredan unprecedented investment in training and inference of new generative AI models. With a 100 million shipped,RTX GPUs provide a massive installed base for AI applications. In October, NVIDIA released our TensorRT LLM library for Windows, accelerating large language modelslike Llama 2 and Mistral up to 5X on RTX PCs. With our new Chat with RTX playground, enthusiasts can connect an RTX-acceleratedLLM to documents or YouTube videos using retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, and chat away. We are also introducing TensorRTacceleration for Stable Diffusion XL and SDXL Turbo in the popularAutomatic1111 app, providing up to 60% boost in performance. Looking forward,AI experiences will be delivered with a hybrid of cloudand PC computation. Hybrid AI will use NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud to run the largest language models, while taking advantage ofRTX tensor cores on your PC to run latency-sensitive applications. We are already seeing hybrid AI in action. For video conferencing, Microsoft Teams offers Copilot,an assistant running in the cloud, while NVIDIA Broadcast runs locally for noise removal and virtual backgrounds. For content creation, Adobe Photoshop includesFirefly-powered Generative Fill running in the cloud, while RTX GPUspower AI tools on the PC. And in gaming, a combination of AI in the cloud and PCwill pull you deeper into the story. Last year, we introduced ACE, our platformfor AI-powered game characters. Let me turn it over to Sethfor more detail. Thanks, Jeff. NVIDIA ACE is a technology platformthat brings digital avatars to life with generative AI. ACE AI models are designed to run in the cloud or locally on the PC. Let's walk through an interactionwith a game character. First, we start with the player's voice input. That prompt is then passed to our automatic speech recognition model,which translates speech to text. Then we feed that text into a large language modelto generate the character's response. After that, the text response is vocalizedusing a text-to-speech model which is then passed to an animation modelto create a realistic lip sync. Finally, the dynamic character is renderedinto the game scene. Here at CES, we are announcingACE Production Microservices for Audio2Face and Automatic Speech Recognition. Available now, each model can be incorporated by our developers individually into their own pipelines. We are working with top digital avatardevelopers to bring NVIDIA ACE technology to gamers. Our latest collaboration is with Convai, a developer platform that enables easy integration of GenAI-powered game characters. Convai’s platform features a set of tools and APIs to create character personas and enable dynamic conversations leveraging the new NVIDIA Audio2faceand Riva microservices. The latest features from Convai enable real-time character-to-character interaction, scene perception, and actions. Let's take a look. In this demo, we're back in the ramen shop with Jin. Except this time we're joined by Nova,a cybersecurity expert in our cyberpunk-flavored world. Let’s listen in as these two AI game characters have a generated conversation.

[SETH, off-screen]The cool thing is the conversationis different every time. [NOVA]Quirky is one word for it, Jin. I think we're just too real to be anythingbut flesh and blood. You're not wrong, Jin. Sometimes I wonder if we're all just partof some elaborate cybernetic dream. If we were AI’s, I'd be the onecracking jokes about the singularity over a bowl of ramen. Kai. Long time no see. You've been hiding in the shadows. Or have you just been trying to avoid me? [SETH]Hey, Nova, it's good to see you. I haven't been trying to avoid you.Just been super busy. How are things? [NOVA]Things are fantastic. Just secured a juicy contractwith Zenith & Sons. [SETH]Hey Jin, you hear that? Nova just landed a big contract. Let's break out the good stuff. [JIN]Ah, you got it, Kai. Nova’s success calls for the top shelfcelebration. Just don't expect this to become a habit. [SETH]Thanks, Jin. So, Nova, have you been playing any games recently? [NOVA] I've been testing this cool game techon a secret new GPU that's launching very soon. I can't talk about it here,but I can show you at the lab. [SETH]Wow, that sounds super cool. Yeah, I'd love to see the game tech. Let's go back to your lab. [NOVA]Absolutely. Follow me and prepare to be blown awayby what you're about to see. With Convai’s latest framework, game characters can now interact with the scene by fetching objects and navigating the world, all based on your conversation. Over to you, Kristina. Thank you, Seth.

NVIDIA and our partners are excitedfor what comes next! And now we will hear from Deepu Tallaabout a new era for robotics. Thanks, Jeff. I would like to share how the infusionof generative AI into robotics is speeding up the ability to bring robotsfrom proof-of-concept to real-world deployment. For the past few years, autonomous robotspowered by artificial intelligence are being increasingly utilizedfor improving efficiency, decreasing costs and tackling labor shortages. Logistics, warehouses, and manufacturing are the first use casesthat had the biggest need. And today, we can seehundreds of thousands of deployed robots, with each of them getting smarteras time goes on due to AI updates. Large-scale fulfillment centersand manufacturing plants that are millions of square feet in area continue to add more smart robots. The next wave of industries for AI-powered smart robotsinclude agriculture, construction, healthcare, and retail. In the last 12 months, generative AI has revolutionized text andnatural language processing. The introduction of ChatGPT has beennoted as the iPhone moment of AI. Very soon we are at the tipping pointof the same technology coming to computer vision and robotics. Generative AI models achieve higher accuracywhile generalizing rather well and applications are builtusing natural language prompts or text. Given these attributes, generativeAI is well-suited for robotics. Now let's see how NVIDIA is bringingthe massive potential of generative AI to robotics. Our platform for building AI-poweredrobots is called NVIDIA Isaac. To deploy AI, there are two computers necessary. The AI factory is where the simulation and training of the AI model happens. It is essentiallythe creation of the model. This process can go on throughoutthe operating life of the robot. The AI model can be continuously improvedso that it gets better and better, more accurate, more performant,and more generalizable. Some applications might demand the AI model to be fine-tuned round-the-clock,365-days-a-year. For example,if you are operating a fleet of autonomous mobile robots, or AMRs,that are marching towards the goal of full autonomy. On the other end of the spectrum, the AI model only needs to beupdated occasionally, and as a result, re-training happensperiodically. For example, a robotic vacuum cleanerthat needs to adapt to your home floor plan. The AI Factory leverages NVIDIA’s data centercompute infrastructure, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Now let's switch to the second computer,which is the run-time of the robot. The computer can be an on-premise server. For example, performing defect inspectionfor a high-speed semiconductor manufacturing line. Or the computer can be an autonomous machine processor,such as an NVIDIA Jetson, powering an AMR or industrialARM with multiple sensors such as 4 to 8 cameras,multiple 2D lidars, 3D lidar, and IMU. Over the past year,we have seen how generative AI-powered chatbots and copilotscan improve our productivity. Applying generativeAI to robotics will be transformative to accelerating the developmentand deployment of smarter robots. If we think back to our two-computermodel, let's see how generative AI, when combined with NVIDIA Omniverserunning in the AI factory, enhances simulation. We are seeing that LLMs caneliminate bottlenecks and turn typical usersinto technical artists. Whether it's creating an individualrobotic work cell or a full-scale manufacturing facility, simulation teamsmake a significant investment to build the right 3D digital twin to test and train their virtual robots. Leveraging the ability to reason andgenerate code with an LLM like ChatGPT the desired scene can be createdfrom a text prompt in minutes. Under the hood,all of the available assets can be utilized and placed in the scenein meaningful ways. Robots often operate indynamic environments, so even after the scene is created,new 3D assets will need to be generated. Starting with NVIDIA's Picasso, a text-to-3Dasset generative AI model, new realistic assets can be generated from a text prompt and placed in the scene. When testing or training a robot, diversity in environments is essential to ensure the robot can generalizeto the real world. Starting with text prompts,generative AI can add rain, water, rust,and more to existing environments and create thousandsof physically accurate scenarios. Tasks that typically take a technical artist days can be completed in minutes. It doesn't end there. Generative AI can act as your copilot when it comes to writing scripts. Simply enter the prompt and generatethe necessary code to run robot simulations or generatesynthetic data that is auto-labeled, saving enormous amounts of expense and time. All of this capability is available or coming soon with NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac Sim. Make sure you leverage itif you're not already doing so. We showed you how Generative AI is supercharging robot simulationand synthetic data generation in the AI factory. Now let's see how generative AI can turbocharge the run-timecapabilities of robots. LLMs and LVMs are making it possible for humans to interact with robotsusing natural language. A generative AI model trained withvideo, text, and other modalities is able to generalize well andachieve higher accuracy than multiple purpose-built CNN-based computer vision models. Let's see how some of our partners are driving the generative AI revolution for their robotic operations. Thank you for tuning in and enjoy CES 2024. How many calculations do you think your graphics card performs every second while running video games with incredibly realistic graphics? Maybe 100 million? Well, 100 million calculations a second is what’s required to run Mario 64 from 1996. We need more power. Maybe 100 billion calculations a second? Well, then you would have a computer that could run Minecraft back in 2011. In order to run the most realistic video games such as Cyberpunk 2077 you need a graphics card that can perform around 36 trillion calculations a second. This is an unimaginably large number, so let’s take a second to try to conceptualize it. Imagine doing a long multiplication problem once every second. Now let’s say everyone on the planet does a similar type of calculation but with different numbers. To reach the equivalent computational power of this graphics card and its 36 trillion calculations a second we would need about 4,400 Earths filled with people, all working together and completing one calculation each every second. It’s rather mind boggling to think that a device can manage all these calculations, so in this video we’ll see how graphics cards work in two parts. First, we’ll open up this graphics card and explore the different components inside, as well as the physical design and architecture of the GPU or graphics processing unit. Second, we’ll explore the computational architecture and see how GPUs process mountains of data, and why they’re ideal for running video game graphics, Bitcoin mining, neural networks and AI.So, stick around and let’s jump right in. This video is sponsored by Micron which manufactures the graphics memory inside this graphics card.Before we dive into all the parts of the GPU, let’s first understand the differences between GPUs and CPUs. Inside this graphics card, the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU has over 10,000 cores. However, when we look at the CPU or Central Processing Unit that’s mounted to the motherboard, we find an integrated circuit or chip with only 24 cores. So, which one is more powerful? 10 thousand is a lot more than 24, so you would think the GPU is more powerful, however, it’s more complicated than that. A useful analogy is to think of a GPU as a massive cargo ship and a CPU as a jumbo jet airplane. The amount of cargo capacity is the amount of calculations and data that can be processed, and the speed of the ship or airplane is the rate at which how quickly those calculations and data are being processed. Essentially, it’s a trade-off between a massive number of calculations that are executed at a slower rate versus a few calculations that can be performed at a much faster rate.Another key difference is that airplanes are a lot more flexible since they can carry passengers, packages, or containers and can take off and land at any one of tens of thousands of airports. Likewise CPUs are flexible in that they can run a variety of programs and instructions. However, giant cargo ships carry only containers with bulk contents inside and are limited to traveling between ports. Similarly, GPUs are a lot less flexible than CPUs and can only run simple instructions like basic arithmetic. Additionally GPUs can’t run operating systems or interface with input devices or networks. This analogy isn’t perfect, but it helps to answer the question of “which is faster, a CPU or a GPU?�. Essentially if you want to perform a set of calculations across mountains of data, then a GPU will be faster at completing the task. However, if you have a lot less data that needs to be evaluated quickly than a CPU will be faster. Furthermore, if you need to run an operating system or support network connections and a wide range of different applications and hardware, then you’ll want a CPU. We’re planning a separate video on CPU architecture, so make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss it, but let’s now dive into this graphics card and see how it works. In the center of this graphics card is the printed circuit board or PCB, with all the various components mounted on it, [Animator Note: Highlight and list out the various parts that will be covered.] and we’ll start by exploring the brains which is the graphics processing unit or GPU. When we open it up, we find a large chip or die named GA102 built from 28.3 billion transistors. The majority of the area of the chip is taken up by the processing cores which have a hierarchical organization. Specifically, the chip is divided into 7 Graphics Processing Clusters or GPCs, and within each processing cluster are 12 streaming multiprocessors or SMs. Next, inside each of these streaming multiprocessors are 4 warps and 1 ray tracing core, and then, inside each warp are 32 Cuda or shading cores and 1 tensor core. Across the entire GPU are 10752 CUDA cores, 336 Tensor Cores, and 84 Ray Tracing Cores. These three types of cores execute all the calculations of the GPU, and each has a different function. CUDA cores can be thought of as simple binary calculators with an addition button, a multiply button and a few others, and are used the most when running video games. Tensor cores are matrix multiplication and addition calculators and are used for geometric transformations and working with neural networks and AI. And ray tracing cores are the largest but the fewest and are used to execute ray tracing algorithms. Now that we understand the computational resources inside this chip, one rather interesting fact is that the 3080, 3090, 3080 ti, and 3090 ti graphics cards all use the same GA102 chip design for their GPU. This might be counterintuitive because they have different prices and were released in different years, but it’s true. So, why is this? Well, during the manufacturing process sometimes patterning errors, dust particles, or other manufacturing issues cause damage and create defective areas of the circuit. Instead of throwing out the entire chip because of a small defect, engineers find the defective region and permanently isolate and deactivate the nearby circuitry. By having a GPU with a highly repetitive design, a small defect in one core only damages that particular streaming multiprocessor circuit and doesn’t affect the other areas of the chip. As a result, these chips are tested and categorized or binned according to the number of defects. The 3090ti graphics cards have flawless GA102 chips with all 10752 CUDA cores working properly, the 3090 has 10,496 cores working, the 3080ti has 10,240 and the 3080 has 8704 CUDA cores working, which is equivalent to having 16 damaged and deactivated streaming multiprocessors. Additionally, different graphics cards differ by their maximum clock speed and the quantity and generation of graphics memory that supports the GPU, which we’ll explore in a little bit. Because we’ve been focusing on the physical architecture of this GA102 GPU chip, let’s zoom into one of these CUDA cores and see what it looks like. Inside this simple calculator is a layout of approximately 410 thousand transistors. This section of 50 thousand transistors performs the operation of A times B plus C which is called fused multiply and add or FMA and is the most common operation performed by graphics cards. Half of the CUDA cores execute FMA using 32-bit floating-point numbers, which is essentially scientific notation, and the other half of the cores use either 32-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers. Other sections of this core accommodate negative numbers and perform other simple functions like bit-shifting and bit masking as well as collecting and queueing the incoming instructions and operands, and then accumulating and outputting the results. As a result, this single core is just a simple calculator with a limited number of functions. This calculator completes one multiply and one add operation each clock cycle and therefore with this 3090 graphics cards and its 10496 cores and 1.7 gigahertz clock, we get 35.6 trillion calculations a second. However, if you’re wondering how the GPU handles more complicated operations like division, square root, and trigonometric functions, well, these calculator operations are performed by the special function units which are far fewer as only 4 of them can be found in each streaming multiprocessor. Now that we have an understanding of what’s inside a single core, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other sections of the GA102 chip. Around the edge we find 12 graphics memory controllers, the NVLink Controllers and the PCIe interface. On the bottom is a 6-megabyte Level 2 SRAM Memory Cache, and here’s the Gigathread Engine which manages all the graphics processing clusters and streaming multiprocessors inside. Now that we’ve explored this GA102 GPU’s physical architecture, let’s zoom out and take a look at the other parts inside the graphics card. On this side are the various ports for the displays to be plugged into, on the other side is the incoming 12 Volt power connector, and then here are the PCIe pins that plug into the motherboard. On the PCB, the majority of the smaller components constitute the voltage regulator module which takes the incoming 12 volts and converts it to one point one volts and supplies hundreds of watts of power to the GPU. Because all this power heats up the GPU, most of the weight of the graphics card is in the form of a heat sink with 4 heat pipes that carry heat from the GPU and memory chips to the radiator fins where fans then help to remove the heat. Perhaps some of the most important components, aside from the GPU, are the 24 gigabytes of graphics memory chips which are technically called GDDR6X SDRAM and were manufactured by Micron which is the sponsor of this video. Whenever you start up a video game or wait for a loading screen, the time it takes to load is mostly spent moving all the 3D models of a particular scene or environment from the solid-state drive into these graphics memory chips. As mentioned earlier, the GPU has a small amount of data storage in its 6-megabyte shared Level 2 cache which can hold the equivalent of about this much of the video game’s environment. Therefore in order to render a video game, different chunks of scene are continuously being transferred between the graphics memory and the GPU. Because the cores are constantly performing tens of trillions of calculations a second, GPUs are data hungry machines and need to be continuously fed terabytes upon terabytes of data, and thus these graphics memory chips are designed kind of like multiple cranes loading a cargo ship at the same time. Specifically, these 24 chips transfer a combined 384 bits at a time, which is called the bus width and the total data that can be transferred, or the bandwidth is about 1.15 terabytes a second. In contrast the sticks of DRAM that support the CPU only have a 64-bit bus width and a maximum bandwidth closer to 64 gigabytes a second. One rather interesting thing is that you may think that computers only work using binary ones and zeros. However, in order to increase data transfer rates, GDDR6X and the latest graphics memory, GDDR7 send and receive data across the bus wires using multiple voltage levels beyond just 0 and 1. For example, GDDR7 uses 3 different encoding schemes to combine binary bits into ternary digits or PAM-3 symbols with voltages of 0, 1, and negative 1. Here’s the encoding scheme on how 3 binary bits are encoded into 2 ternary digits and this scheme is combined with an 11 bit to 7 ternary digit encoding scheme resulting in sending 276 binary bits using only 176 ternary digits. The previous generation, GDDR6X, which is the memory in this 3090 graphics card, used a different encoding scheme, called PAM-4, to send 2 bits of data using 4 different voltage levels, however, engineers and the graphics memory industry agreed to switch to PAM-3 for future generations of graphics chips in order to reduce encoder complexity, improve the signal to noise ratio, and improve power efficiency. Micron delivers consistent innovation to push the boundaries on how much data can be transferred every second and to design cutting edge memory chips. Another advancement by Micron is the development of HBM, or the high bandwidth memory, that surrounds AI chips. HBM is built from stacks of DRAM memory chips and uses TSVs or through silicon vias, to connect this stack into a single chip, essentially forming a cube of AI memory. For the latest generation of high bandwidth memory, which is HBM3E, a single cube can have up to 24 to 36 gigabytes of memory, thus yielding 192 gigabytes of high-speed memory around the AI chip. Next time you buy an AI accelerator system, make sure it uses Micron’s HBM3E which uses 30% less power than the competitive products. However, unless you’re building an AI data center, you’re likely not in the market to buy one of these systems which cost between 25 to 40 thousand dollars and are on backorder for a few years. If you’re curious about high bandwidth memory, or Micron’s next generation of graphics memory take a look at one of these links in the description. Alternatively, if designing the next generation of memory chips interests you, Micron is always looking for talented scientists and engineers to help innovate on cutting edge chips and you can find out more about working for Micron using this link. Now that we’ve explored many of the physical components inside this graphics card and GPU, let’s next explore the computational architecture and see how applications like video game graphics and bitcoin mining run what’s called “embarrassingly� parallel operations. Although it may sound like a silly name, embarrassingly parallel is actually a technical classification of computer problems where little or no effort is needed to divide the problem into parallel tasks, and video game rendering and bitcoin mining easily fall into this category. Essentially, GPUs solve embarrassingly parallel problems using a principle called SIMD, which stands for single instruction multiple data where the same instructions or steps are repeated across thousands to millions of different numbers. Let’s see an example of how SIMD or single instruction multiple data is used to create this 3D video game environment. As you may know already, this cowboy hat on the table is composed of approximately 28 thousand triangles built by connecting together around 14,000 vertices, each with X, Y, and Z coordinates. These vertex coordinates are built using a coordinate system called model space with the origin of 0,0,0 being at the center of the hat.To build a 3D world we place hundreds of objects, each with their own model space into the world environment and, in order for the camera to be able to tell where each object is relative to other objects, we have to convert or transform all the vertices from each separate model space into the shared world coordinate system or world space. So, as an example, how do we convert the 14 thousand vertices of the cowboy hat from model space into world space? Well, we use a single instruction which adds the position of the origin of the hat in world space to the corresponding X,Y, and Z coordinate of a single vertex in model space. Next we copy this instruction to multiple data, which is all the remaining X,Y, and Z coordinates of the other thousands of vertices that are used to build the hat. Next, we do the same for the table and the rest of the hundreds of other objects in the scene, each time using the same instructions but with the different objects’ coordinates in world space, and each objects’ thousands of vertices in model space. As a result, all the vertices and triangles of all the objects are converted to a common world space coordinate system and the camera can now determine which objects are in front and which are behind. This example illustrates the power of SIMD or single instruction multiple data and how a single instruction is applied to 5,629 different objects with a total of 8.3 million vertices within the scene resulting in 25 million addition calculations. The key to SIMD and embarrassingly parallel programs is that every one of these millions of calculations has no dependency on any other calculation, and thus all these calculations can be distributed to the thousands of cores of the GPU and completed in parallel with one another. It's important to note that vertex transformation from model space to world space is just one of the first steps of a rather complicated video game graphics rendering pipeline and we have a separate video that delves deeper into each of these other steps. Also, we skipped over the transformations for the rotation and scale of each object, but factoring in these values is a similar process that requires additional SIMD calculations. Now that we have a simple understanding of SIMD, let’s discuss how this computational architecture matches up with the physical architecture. Essentially, each instruction is completed by a thread and this thread is matched to a single CUDA core. Threads are bundled into groups of 32 called warps, and the same sequence of instructions is issued to all the threads in a warp. Next warps are grouped into thread blocks which are handled by the streaming multiprocessor. And then finally thread blocks are grouped into grids, which are computed across the overall GPU. All these computations are managed or scheduled by the Gigathread Engine, which efficiently maps thread blocks to the available streaming multiprocessors. One important distinction is that within SIMD architecture, all 32 threads in a warp follow the same instructions and are in lockstep with each other, kind of like a phalanx of soldiers moving together. This lock step execution applied to GPUs up until around 2016. However, newer GPUs follow a SIMT architecture or single instruction multiple threads. The difference between SIMD and SIMT is that while both send the same set of instructions to each thread, with SIMT, the individual threads don’t need to be in lockstep with each other and can progress at different rates. In technical jargon, each thread is given its own program counter. Additionally, with SIMT all the threads within a streaming multiprocessor use a shared 128 kilobyte L1 cache and thus data that’s output by one thread can be subsequently used by a separate thread. This improvement from SIMD to SIMT allows for more flexibility when encountering warp divergence via data-dependent conditional branching and easier reconvergence for the threads to reach the barrier synchronization. Essentially newer architectures of GPUs are more flexible and efficient especially when encountering branches in code. One additional note is that although you may think that the term warp is derived from warp drives, it actually comes from weaving and specifically the Jacquard Loom. This loom from 1804 used programmable punch cards to select specific threads out of a set to weave together intricate patterns. As fascinating as looms are, let’s move on. The final topics we’ll explore are bitcoin mining, tensor cores and neural networks. But first we’d like to ask you to ‘like’ this video, write a quick comment below, share it with a colleague, friend or on social media, and subscribe if you haven’t already. The dream of Branch Education is to make free and accessible, visually engaging educational videos that dive deeply into a variety topics on science, engineering, and how technology works, and then to combine multiple videos into an entirely free engineering curriculum for high school and college students. Taking a few seconds to like, subscribe, and comment below helps us a ton! Additionally, we have a Patreon page with AMAs and behind the scenes footage, and, if you find what we do useful, we would appreciate any support. Thank you. So now that we’ve explored how single instruction multiple threads is used in video games, let’s briefly discuss why GPUs were initially used for mining bitcoin. We’re not going to get too far into the algorithm behind the blockchain and will save it for a separate episode, but essentially, to create a block on the blockchain, the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is run on a set of data that includes transactions, a time stamp, additional data, and a random number called a nonce. After feeding these values through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm a random 256-bit value is output. You can kind of think of this algorithm as a lottery ticket generator where you can’t pick the lottery number, but based on the input data, the SHA-256 algorithm generates a random lottery ticket number. Therefore, if you change the nonce value and keep the rest of the transaction data the same, you’ll generate a new random lottery ticket number. The winner of this bitcoin mining lottery is the first randomly generated lottery number to have the first 80 bits all zeroes, while the rest of the 176 values don’t matter and once a winning bitcoin lottery ticket is found, the reward is 3 bitcoin and the lottery resets with a new set of transactions and input values. So, why were graphics cards used? Well, GPUs ran thousands of iterations of the SHA-256 algorithm with the same transactions, timestamp, other data, but, with different nonce values. As a result, a graphics card like this one could generate around 95 million SHA-256 hashes or 95 million randomly numbered lottery tickets every second, and hopefully one of those lottery numbers would have the first 80 digits as all zeros. However, nowadays computers filled with ASICs or application specific integrated circuits perform 250 trillion hashes a second or the equivalent of 2600 graphics cards, thereby making graphics cards look like a spoon when mining bitcoin next to an excavator that is an asic mining computer. Let’s next discuss the design of the tensor cores. It’ll take multiple full-length videos to cover generative AI, and neural networks, so we’ll focus on the exact matrix math that tensor cores solve. Essentially, tensor cores take three matrices and multiply the first two, add in the third and then output the result. Let’s look at one value of the output. This value is equal to the sum of values of the first row of the first matrix multiplied by the values from the first column of the second matrix, and then the corresponding value of the third matrix is added in. Because all the values of the 3 input matrices are ready at the same time, the tensor cores complete all of the matrix multiplication and addition calculations concurrently. Neural Networks and generative AI require trillions to quadrillions of matrix multiplication and addition operations and typically uses much larger matrices. Finally, there are Ray Tracing Cores which we explored in a separate video that’s already been released. That’s pretty much it for graphics cards.

your pioneering contributions exemplify the spirit of progress that drives the field forward as a result of this groundbreaking work accelerated Computing has become the technology of choice for supercomputing this chart shows the history of accelerated and unaccelerated supercomputers among the top 100 fastest systems in the world in The Last 5 Years the number of accelerated systems has increased by 8 systems per year and increased from 33% to over 70% of the top 100 our goal is to help the world accelerate every workload it is certainly ambitious given the wide range of programming languages breath of developer experience and needs and ongoing emerging algorithms and techniques to support our developer community and meet them where they are today we offer over 450 libraries many which are tailored to specific domains an Ever evolving developer landscape take python for example warp is our pythonic framework for building and accelerating data generation and spatial Computing most physics based simulators in HBC engage in some form of spatial Computing whether it in quantum chemistry climate modeling or fluid dynamics all of which operate in 3D space and by expressing these calculations and warp they can be automatically differentiated and integrated into AI workflows one of the most most popular python libraries that exist today is numpy numpy is the foundation library for mathematical Computing for python developers it's used by over 5 million scientific and Industrial developers with 300 million downloads just last month over 32,000 GitHub applications use numpy in important science domains like astronomy physics signal processing and many others however as scientists look to scale their applications to use large HPC clusters they often need to use lower level distributed computing libraries like open MPI but what if you didn't what if your numpy program could just automatically paralyze across a GPU cluster without having to rewrite the Python program into a different supercomputing application today we're announcing Cai numeric a dropin replacement for the numpy library with cpai numeric researchers can write in Python and easily scale their work without needing expert in distributed computing Cai numeric automatically distributes the data across a GPU cluster using standard numpy data types powered by nvidia's latest communication and math libraries the results are incredible the research team at slack is using coupon numeric to analyze terabytes of data from the lcls x-ray laser which fires 120 shots per second during a 60-hour beam time they achieved a 6X speed up in data analysis allowing to make realtime decisions and uncover material properties this acceleration has reduced their analysis time before publication

scaling ml algorithms for the Vado supercomputer and the University of Massachusetts Boston studying the entripy production rate in a microscopy Imaging experiment one of the highest honors at supercomputing is the Gordon Bell prize recognizing exceptional achievements in high performance Computing today we celebrate five finalist teams whose groundbreaking research leverages nvidia's accelerated systems across diverse Fields including molecular Dynamics protein design genomics and climate modeling JPI Barka and his team from the University of canaba and Melbourne University scaled an alternative method for calculating Atomic energies achieving a 3X speed up over other GPU accelerated methods and a super linear scaling on multiple gpus later we'll hear from Dr David keys at coust about their pioneering work on genomic epistasis and climate emulation but first let's turn to Dr Arvin ramanathan from argon National Laboratory to discuss their advancements in protein design one of the key tasks in protein design is to come up with novel proteins that have the same function but are different from what we have seen from over the course of 4 billion years of evolution experimental data happens to come at much slower Paces than what you would expect from a computational workflow like a simulation protein design is quite a happening area in AI right now it's undergoing this huge revolution in terms of how AI models are being deployed and developed this is one of the the first attempts at building something that's IM multimodal we actually have the descriptions that are provided in natural language and then you have the protein sequences that are represented and we basically use that to train a large language model that will enable us to interact with and get new designs and one of the key things that we also learned from this paper was the fact that yes it is possible for us to stand up this workflow not on just one platform but across several different platforms at the same time we happen to use almost all of nvidia's architecture from 00s all the way to Grace Hopper chips but one of the cool things that we observed was in terms of pre-training this model we could really achieve nearly three xof flops in mixed Precision runs on the system again this sort of runs at the scale of I think half of the system was what we actually used to achieve that sort of performance is really [Music] unbelievable one of the key benefits and motivations for accelerating workloads is to reduce energy consumption nowhere is this more understood than in supercomputing where the end of Mo's law was first predicted supercomputing centers like oish National Labs as far back as 2010 recognized that the energy for NextGen supercomputers built with CPUs will consume even more power than a major US city this truth also applies to Applications themselves even though an accelerated server May consume more power than a standard CPU system the significant reduction in time to solution results in a huge reduction in the total energy needed to compute a solution for example Texas Advanced Computing Center and Anis achieved a 110x speed up and 6X better Energy Efficiency on a 2.5 billion cell problem using Grace Hopper at enal h100 gpus improved Energy Efficiency by 4X for a wind farm simulation tsmc reduced energy use by 9x using kitho for Semiconductor manufacturing the University of Tokyo's earthquake Research Institute in partnership with jamstack and riken also achieved an 86x speed up and 32 times better Energy Efficiency for earthquake simulations using the Euro HBC Alp system we are continuously pushing for higher performance and efficiency in AI as well large language models like llama 3.1 405b require multiple gpus working together for Optimal Performance to fully utilize these gpus our inference software stack provides optimized parallelism techniques relying on Fast data transfers between gpus nvidia's EnV switch technology equips Hopper with Superior GPU to GPU throughput and when integrated with our trt llm software stack deliver continuous performance improvements this insures Hopper achieves higher performance and lower cost per token for models like 405b in just two months we've seen over a 1.6x Improvement in performance thanks to Innovations in speculative execution mvlink communication and specialized AI kernels and we're not stopping with hopper we're actively innovating to harness the power of Blackwell to build Next Generation AI factories we're excited to collaborate and support customer successes within our growing solution ecosystem our partners offer a wide range of systems from Hopper to Blackwell the h200 mvl is specifically designed for air cooled flexible HPC Solutions featuring a 4 GPU mvlink domain in a standard pcie form factor we're also working with Partners to bring Grace Blackwell configurations to Market these include the gb200 grace Blackwell nvl 4 super chip which integrates a 4 GPU EnV link domain with a dual grce CPU for liquid cooled scientific Computing the roll out of Blackwell Solutions is progressing smoothly thanks to our reference architecture enabling Partners to quickly bring products to Market while adding their own customizations our goal is to accelerate every workload to drive Discovery and maximize Energy Efficiency this includes both accelerated and partially accelerated applications that can take advantage of tightly coupled CPU and GPU products like Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell however not everything takes advantage of acceleration just yet for this long tail using the most energy efficient CPU in a power constrained data center environment maximizes workload through put the grace CPU is purpose-built for high performance and Energy Efficiency Grace features 72 arm neoverse V2 cores and the Nvidia scale coherency fabric which delivers 3.2 tab a second of bandwidth double that of a traditional CPU paired with lpddr 5x memory it can achieve 500 GB a second of memory bandwidth while consuming just 16 Watts that's 1/5 the power of conventional DDR memory these Innovations enable Grace to deliver up to 4X the performance for workloads like weather forecasting and geoscience when compared to x86 systems making an ideal solution for energy efficient high performance CPU Computing earlier this year at computex Jensen unveiled our next Generation Arm based CPU Vera set to debut in 2026 it will be available both as a standalone product and as a tightly integrated solution with the reuin GPU with a focus on data movement our next Generation CPU Fabric and nvlink chipto Chip Technologies are designed to maximize system performance ver will be a versatile CPU capable of delivering performance and efficiency across a wide range of compute and memory intensive tasks and it's not just about single node Computing networking plays a critical role in today's accelerated Computing platforms traditional ethernet was designed for Enterprise data centers optimized for single server workloads nvidia's Envy link combined with infin band or Spectrum X ethernet sets the gold stand standard for AI training and inference data centers this combination enables extreme scalability and Peak Performance nvlink switch systems allow gpus to scale up and communicate seamlessly as a unified ho for East West compute Fabrics where fast data exchange between gpus is critical Nvidia Quantum infiniband and Spectrum X ethernet provide the low latency High throughput infrastructure needed to scale Beyond mvlink domains for North South traffic Bluefield dpus optimize data flow between the data center and the external networks ensuring both efficiency and security together these Technologies create a powerful and resilient infrastructure for large scale Ai and HPC workloads Nvidia Quantum infiniband delivers unmatched high-speed data transfer with minimal latency essential for parallel processing and distributed computing the quantum x800 platform features a 144 Port switch with 800 gbits per Port powered by the connect X8 supernick together they support MPI and nickel offloads enabling 14.4 Tera flops of in network computing with Nvidia sharp without sharp all reduced operations require repeated point-to-point transfers sharp can optimize this by performing data reductions directly within the network switches reducing data transfer and boosting efficiency this results in a 1.8x more effective bandwidth for AI applications Microsoft Azure a longtime user of infiniband for scientific simulations will be among the first to adopt the advanced Quantum x800 for developing cuttingedge trillion parameter models many customers want to use ethernet instead of infiniband to simplify their operations however standard ethernet was not built to meet the demands of ai ai factories alternate between GPU compute periods and Collective operation data transfers Network delays introduced can cause tail latencies which slows the overall workload performance this histogram comparison shows how Spectrum X reduces tail latency compared to traditional ethernet in multi-tenant deployments Spectrum x with noise isolation eliminates Network hotspots and can deliver 2.2x better all reduced performance by dynamically rebalancing to avoid failed links Spectrum X increases point-to-point bandwidth by 1.3x this results in Superior performance and reliability for the largest AI data center deployments last month X announced the world's largest accelerated system the Colossus supercomputer this system is built by Dell and super micro featuring 100,000 h100 gpus to train grock 3 one of the world's most advanced large language models we've worked dilig ently ly with our partners to deploy Colossus in record time going from equipment delivery to training in just 19 days and full scale production within 122 days thus far X has been thrilled with the system performance Spectrum X ethernet is achieving an impressive 95% of theoretical data throughput compared to 60% with traditional ethernet Solutions the system also maintains zero latency degradation and no packet loss due to flow collisions across the the three tiers of the network fabric this deployment sets a new standard for AI at scale we are extremely excited to announce that Spectrum X is making its debut on the top 500 list in fact two Spectrum X powered systems find themselves in the top 50 both are Dell based one built by GMO internet group and the other by our very own Nvidia isra1 supercomputer I'm sure these will be the first of many to come we build our platform on a one-year Cadence continually advancing each component to redefine performance and efficiency but it's not just about the hardware continuous software optimization is key with every cycle we enhance our software stack to extract more from our gpus CPUs and dpus this means users can consistently leverage Cutting Edge advancements without disruption leading to compounding improvements today Blackwell is in full production next year Blackwell Ultra raise the bar even higher followed by Reuben ensuring that each generation builds on the last to deliver even greater breakthroughs in Ai and HPC over the past year we've witnessed an explosion of new Aid driven use cases data sets and foundational models a standout example is evolutionary scales work in accelerating drug Discovery with the release of the esm3 generative model for protein design built on the Nvidia accelerated Computing platform platform esm3 was trained on over 2 billion protein sequences using 60 times more data and 25 times more computing power than its predecessor esm2 now let's hear from Dr David keys of cou to tell us about their two Gordon Bell finalist submissions for genomics and climate modeling genomewide Association studies explore the great dogma of biology that genotype leads to phenotype genotype here includes not only genomic factors but also environmental factors like demographics diet smoking habits and so forth and the goal is to start with a large database of individuals we used the 305,000 person UK biobank and uh then compare their genomes and their generalized genotypes to one another and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject we actually were able by means of scaling up to go from the 3 5,000 patients for which we have real data to a synthetic database generated from 13 million patients and that number is actually enough for more than half the countries of the world to do a full genomic analysis of their populations we had very little difficulty moving the code from one to another so in particular we ran on the v100s of summit we ran on the A1 100s of Leonardo and we ran on the hopper 100s the GH configuration of Alps node for node Hopper is by far the most interesting in terms of performance and also because it offers the fp8 and we're happy to use it as close to the low Precision end as we can get away with and would encourage other domain scientists to try to take advantage of that this is a very exciting prospect uh because many future venues of smart health and smart agriculture will benefit greatly from a democratized genomewide Association studies there is a 45 institution campaign in its sixth generation of generating future climates called seip and they are starting to become handicapped by the volume of data that they produce and each of these institutions is devoting hundreds of millions of core hours to generating these future climates climate emulation is a statistical model that tries to reproduce the statistics of the chaotic simulations we actually brought the queriable distance down to about 3 and 1/2 km from maybe 100 km on earlier models we were able to obtain 8 exif flops of mixed Precision on the Alps system and that was on 2,000 of those nodes I think a digital twin is reproducing the statistics of the real world by making the full 2D surface of the Earth visible at very high resolution with data compression uh with Statistics that reproduce ensembles of pte based models we feel that we've democratized climate [Music] emulation it is incredible to see all the great work being done by researchers to harness the power of AI for science while training AI models is important the real value relies in deploying these models and using them in inference where they can generate insights and predictions in real time to make it easier for users to scale AI models in production we've introduced Nvidia

10,000 times more energy efficient than traditional highresolution numerical weather prediction using CPUs we've also worked with us weather forecasting agencies to develop a ctive model for the entire continental US an area 300 times larger than the original Taiwan based model however not every use case requires high resolution forecasts some applications can benefit from more larger ensembles at corser resolutions state-of-the-art numerical models like the GFS are limited to 20 ensembles due to computational constraints today we're also announcing the availability of forecast net Nim it can deliver Global two-e forecasts 5,000 times faster than numerical weather models this makes it possible to use ensembles with thousands of members opening new opportunities for climate Tech

potential to make the same impact in digital chemistry with an estimated 10 to the 60th possible materials in the universe and only 10 to the eth currently known there's huge potential to innovate announcing Nvidia Alchemy it's a collection of chemistry specific Nims for the discovery of new compounds scientists start by defining the properties they want like strength conductivity low toxicity or even color a generative model suggests thousands to millions of potential candidates with the desired properties then the Alchemy Nim can sort the candidate compounds for stability by solving for their lowest energy states using Nvidia warp resulting in 100 times faster design space search going from months to a day using the Alchemy workflow the best candidates are identified before moving forward to costly real world testing traditional engineering analysis workflows from physics simulation to visualization can take weeks or even months to complete most analysis of physical systems like planes and Automobiles and ships use a set of loosely coupled applications each generating information which must be interpreted by engineers at each step a real-time digital twin enables an engineer to adjust design parameters for example you could change the shape of a body panel and see how it impacts streamlines in real time announcing Omniverse blueprint for realtime digital twins the blueprint is a reference workflow that includes nvidia's acceleration libraries physics AI Frameworks and Omniverse to design simulate and visualize all in real time it can run on all Cloud platforms as well as nvidia's own djx cloud Al Cadence seens and others are exploring how to integrate the blueprint into their own services and products for design acceleration Nvidia is also collaborating with fre scale to incorporate the blueprint into their physics AI platform let's take a look at the blueprint in action everything manufactured is first simulated with Advanced physics

interoperability the engineer can even bring new new geometries and the simulation will adapt instantly what took weeks or even months is now a matter of seconds software developers everywhere can now bring unprecedented speed and flexibility to the world's industrial designers and Engineers helping save massive cost and shorten the time to Market ansus is adopting nvidia's Technologies into its CA platform Anis fluent accelerated by Nvidia gpus Insight powered by Omniverse visualization and Sim AI built on Nvidia Nim microservices AI will not only transform simulation it will accelerate scientific experimentation as well an overwhelming amount of data is being generated by Advanced instruments such as radio telescopes particle accelerators x-ray light sources and fusion reactor experiments for example the square kilometer array is expected to be completed by the end of the decade the ska in Australia will produce an average of 1 terabyte a second a thousand times more than the current state-of-the-art array in particle physics the lhcb detector at CERN produces 5 terabytes of data per second following the 2030 upgrade it could reach as high as 25 terabytes per second both the instruments and the researchers time are incredibly valuable making essential to extract meaningful insights from all of this data as efficiently as possible we are working with the researchers at the SEI Institute and breakthrough listen to deploy the world's first AI search for fast radio bursts or F frbs while over 1,000 have been detected only 15 have been traced to specific galaxies we've implemented a realtime pipeline using Nvidia Hollow scan at the Allen telescope array processing data from 28 dishes at 100 gbits per second this pipeline can process 100 times more data than conventional methods used today this is the first direct feed of raw telescope data to an AI model for f frb detection Quantum Hardware offers the opportunity to revolutionize Computing in fundamental ways unfortunately today's best quantum processors can only perform hundreds of operations before their fundamental unit of computation their cubits just become overwhelmed wood noise this makes scaling Quantum Hardware into useful Computing devices impractical today we're announcing a partnership with Google to apply nvidia's state-of-the-art AI supercomputing to solve this Challenge and accelerate their Quantum Hardware development to be useful quantum computers need large numbers of cubits operating with performance far beyond today's capabilities AI supercomputing is the key to building higher quality error corrected cubits that can meet these demands Google Quantum AI is working with Nvidia to explore how to accelerate digital representations of their superconducting cubits unlike circuit simulations which focus on the highle operation of an ideal quantum computer dynamical simulations model the complex physics describing real noisy Quantum Hardware fully accounting for how the cubits inside the quantum processor interact not only with each other but also with their surrounding environment dynamical simulations are essential to understanding and reducing Cubit

computing 2024 [Music] Jensen this is such an honor thank you for being here I'm delighted to be here thank you in honor of your return to Stanford I decided we'd start talking about the time when you first left you joined LSI logic and that was one of the most exciting companies at the time you're building a phenomenal reputation with some of the biggest names in Tech and yet you decide to leave to become a Founder what motivated you uh uh Chris and Curtis Chris and Curtis uh uh I was an engineer at LS logic and Chris and Curtis were at Sun and I was working with with uh some of the brightest Minds in computer science at the time of all time uh including andyto shim and others uh building building workstations and Graphics workstations and so on so forth and uh Chris and Curtis uh uh said one day that they like to leave some son and they like uh me to go figure out what they're going to go leave four and and um I had a great job but they they insisted that I uh figure out you know with them how to how to build a company and so so we hung out at Denny when whenever they Dro by and and uh uh which was which is by the way my alma marter my my first company uh you know my first job before for before CEO was a was a dishwasher and so and and I did that very well and and so anyways uh we got together and and we we DEC and it was during the the microprocessor Revolution this is 1993 and and 1992 when we were getting together the PC Revolution was just getting going you you know that Windows 95 obviously which is the Revolutionary version of Windows uh didn't even come to the market yet and Pentium wasn't even announced yet and so and this is this is all before the right before the PC Revolution and it was it was pretty clear that that uh the microprocessor was going to be very important and we we thought you know why don't we build a company uh to go solve problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose Computing can't and and so that that became the company's Mission uh to go to go build a computer uh the type of computers and solve problems that normal computers can't and to this day uh we're focusing on that and if you look at all the the problems that that um and the markets that we opened up as a result uh it's you know things like uh computational drug design um uh weather simulation materials design these are all things that we're really really proud of uh robotics uh self-driving cars uh autonomous autonomous uh software we call artificial intelligence and then all you know of course uh we uh we drove the the uh U the techn techology so hard that that eventually the computational cost uh uh went to approximately zero and then enabled enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself artificial intelligence as we know it today and so so I that was that was it that was the journey yeah thank you all for [Laughter] coming well these applications are on all of our minds today but back then the CEO of LSI logic convinced his biggest investor Don Valentine to meet with you he is obviously the founder of seoa yeah now I can see a lot of Founders here edging forward in anticipation but how did you convince the most sought-after investor in Silicon Valley to invest in a team of firsttime Founders building a new product for a market that doesn't even exist I I didn't know how to write a business plan and and uh uh so I went to a went to a book bookstore and back then there were bookstores and and and um in the business book section there was this book and it was written by somebody I knew Gordon Bell and this book I should go find it again but it's a very large book and the book says how to write a business plan and and that was you know a highly specific title for a very niche market and it seems like he wrote it for like you know 14 people and I was one of them and and so I I bought the book I I should have known right away that that it was a bad idea because that you know Gordon is super super smart and super smart people have a lot to say and and they wanted you know and I I'm pretty sure Gordon wants to teach me how to write a business plan uh completely and so I I picked up this book it's like 450 pages long well I never got through it not even close I I flipped through it a few pages and I go you know what by the time I'm done reading this this thing I'll be out of business I'll be out of money and and uh Lori and I only had about 6 months uh in the bank and we had already Spencer Madison and and uh and a dog and so the five of us had to live off of you know uh whatever money we had in the bank and and so I didn't have much time uh and so instead of writing the business plan uh I just went to talk to to W Coran he turn he called me one day and said hey you know you left the company you didn't even tell me what you were doing I want you to come back and explain it to me and so I went back and I explained it to Wi and wi wi at the end of it he he said I have no idea what you said and and um that's one of the worst elevator pitches I've ever heard um and then he picked up the phone and he called Don Valentine and he he called Don and he says Don I want you to give I'm going to send a kid over I want you to give him money he's one of the best employees l logic ever ever had and um I and and so the thing I learned is is uh uh you you can make up a great interview you could even have a bad interview but you can't run away from your past and so have a good past you know try to have a good past and and and in a lot of ways I was serious when I said I was a good dishwasher I was probably Denny's best dishwasher um I I planned my work I was organized you know I was Misan plus and then I washed The Living Daylights out of the dishes and then and then you know they promoted me to bus I was certain I'm the best bus boy Denny's ever had you know I was I never left a station with empty-handed I never came back empty-handed I was very efficient and then they and so anyways eventually I became you know a CEO I'm working I'm still working on being being a good CEO but you talk about being the bad you needed to be the best among 89 other companies that were funded after you to build the same thing and then with 6 to9 months of Runway left you realized that the initial Vision was just not going to work MH how did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you well we started uh this company called for Accelerated Computing and the question is what is it for what's the killer app and and uh that was that that came our first great decision um and this is what sequa funded the first great decision was the first killer app was going to be 3D graphics and the the the technology was going to be 3D graphics and the application was going to be video games at the Time 3D Graphics was impossible to make cheap it was Million dooll image generators from Silicon graphics and the video and so it was a million dollars and and it's hard to make cheap um and the video game Market was0 billion doar so you have this incredible technology that's hard to uh commoditize and commercialize and then you have this Market that doesn't exist that was that intersection was the founding of our company and and I still remember uh when when Don at the end of my presentation uh you know Don was still kind of he he said you know know one of the things he said to me which made a lot of sense back then makes a lot of sense today he says startups don't invest in startups or startups don't partner with startups and his point is that in order for NVIDIA to succeed we needed another startup to succeed and that other startup was Electronic Arts and and then on the way out he he reminded me that electronic arts's CTO is 14 years old and had to be driven to work by his mom and he just wanted to remind me that that's who I'm relying on that that and then and uh and then after that he said if you lose my money I'll kill you and that that was that was kind of my memories of that first meeting uh but nonetheless uh we created we created something uh we went on uh the next several years to go create the market to create the gaming market for PCs and it took a long time to do so we're still doing it today uh we realize that not only do you have to create the technology and uh invent a new way of doing computer Graphics so that what was a million dollars is now you know three 400 $500 um that fits in the computer and you have to go create this new market so we have to create technology create markets the idea that a company would create technology create markets defines Nvidia today almost everything we do we create technology we create markets that's that's the reason why people say we have a you know people call it a stack an ecosystem words like that um but that's basically it at the core for 30 years what Nvidia realized we had to do is in order to uh create the conditions by which somebody could buy our products we had to go invent this new market and uh it's the reason why we were early in autonomous driving it was the reason why we're early in deep learning it was the reason why we're early and just about all these things including uh computational drug disc drug design and and Discovery um all these different areas we're trying to create the market while we're creating the technology and so that that's um uh okay and then we got we got going and and then and then um Microsoft introduced uh a standard called direct 3D and that spawned off hundreds of companies and we found ourselves a couple years later competing with just about everybody and and the thing that that we invented the company the technology we invented uh 3D graphics with the consumerized 3D with turns out to be incompatible with direct 3D so we started this company we had this 3D Graphics thing we million-dollar thing we're trying to make it consumerized and so we invented all this technology and then shortly after it became incompatible and um uh so we had to reset the company uh or go out of business but we didn't know how to we didn't know how to build it the way that Microsoft had defined it and um and I remember I remember a meeting at at you know on a weekend and the conversation was you know we now have 89 competitors uh I understand that the way we do it is not not right but we don't know how to do it the right way and and um thankfully there was another bookstore and um and the bookstore is called fries Fries electronics I don't think I don't know if it's still here um and so I had I had I had um I I I think I drove madis and my daughter on a weekend to fries and and it was sitting right there the openg manual uh which would defined uh how silicon Graphics did computer graphics and so it was it was right there it was like $68 a book and so I had a couple hundred dollar I bought three books I took it back to the office and I said guys I found it our future and I handed out I had three versions of it handed out had a big nice centerfold you know the centerfold is the opengl pipeline which is the computer Graphics Pipeline and um uh and I handed it to uh the same Geniuses that I founded the company with and we implemented the openg pipeline like nobody had ever implemented the opengl pipeline and we built something the world never seen and so uh a lot of lessons are right there that moment in time for our company uh gave us so much confidence and the reason for that is you can succeed in doing something inventing a future even if you were not informed about it at all and is kind of the my attitude about everything now you know when somebody tells me about something and I've never heard of it before or if I've heard of it never don't understand how it works at all my first thought is always you know how hard can it be and it's probably just a textbook away you know you're probably one archive paper away from figuring this out and so I spent a lot of time reading archive papers and um and it it's true it's true you can you can um now of course you can't learn how somebody else does something and do it exactly the same way and hope to have a different outcome but you could learn how something can be done and then go back to First principles and ask yourself um giving the conditions today given my motivation given the instruments the tools um given you know how things have changed how would I redo this how would I reinvent this whole thing how would I design a how would I build a car today would I build it incrementally from 1950s and 1900s how would I build a computer today how would I write software today does that make sense and so I go back to First principles all the time uh even in the company today and just reset ourselves you know because the world has changed and U the way we wrote software in the past was monolithic and it's designed for supercomputers but now it's disaggregated it's you know so on so forth and how we think about software today how we think about computers today how we think just always cause your company always cause yourself to go back to first first principles and it creates lots and lots of opportunities yeah the way you applied this technology turns to be revolutionary you get all the momentum that you need to IPO and then some more because you grow your Revenue nine times in the next four years but in the middle of all of this success you decide to Pivot a little bit the focus of innovation happening at Nvidia based on a phone call you have with this chemistry professor can you tell us about that phone call and how you connected the dots from what you heard to where you went uh remember at the core the company was uh pioneering a new way of doing Computing computer Graphics was the first application uh but we already always knew that there would be other applications and so image processing came particle physics came fluids came so on so forth all kinds of interesting things that we wanted to do uh we made the processor more programmable so that we could express more algorithms if you will and then one day we invented um uh programable shaders which made all forms of Imaging and computer Graphics programmable that was a great breakthrough so we invented Ed that on top of that we invented uh we we tried to look for ways to express um uh more comp more sophisticated algorithms uh that could be computation that could be computed on our processor which is very different than a CPU and so we we created this thing called CG this I think it was 2003 or so C for gpus it predated Cuda by about three years um the same person who wrote The textbook that saved the company Mark Hilgard wrote that textbook and um I and so CG was was super cool we wrote textbooks about it we started teaching people how to use it we developed tools and such um and then several several researchers discovered it uh many of the researchers here students here at Stanford was using it um many of the the engineers that that then became uh engineers at Nvidia were were uh playing with it uh uh a doctor a couple of doctors at at Mass General picked it up and used it for uh CT reconstruction so I flew out and saw them and said you know what are you guys doing with this thing and uh they told me about that and then and then uh a um uh a computational a Quantum chemist uh used it to um uh Express his his algorithms and so I I realized that that there's there's some evidence that people might want to use this uh and and it gave it gave us gave us you know incrementally more more confidence that that we ought to go do this that that this field this form of computing could solve problems that normal computers really can't and and um reinforced our belief and and kept us going every time you heard something new you really savored that surprise and that seems to be a theme throughout your leadership at Nvidia U it feels like you make the these bets so far in advance of Technology inflections that when the Apple finally falls from the tree you're standing right there in your black leather jacket waiting to catch it how do you find the conv always seems like a diving catch oh it does seem like a diving catch you do things based on core beliefs you know we we uh we we deeply believe that that we uh we could create a computer that solves problems Norm processing can't do that there are limits to what a CPU can do there are limits to what general purpose Computing can do and then there are interesting problems uh that we can go solve the question the question is always are those in interesting problems only or are they can they also be interesting markets because if they're not interesting markets it's not sustainable and Nvidia went through about a decade where we were investing in this future and the markets didn't exist there was only One Market at the time was computer Graphics uh for 10 15 years the markets that fuels Nvidia today just didn't exist and so so how do you continue um uh with all of the people around you you know our company and you know nvidia's management team and all of the amazing Engineers that they're creating this future with me um all of your shareholders your board of directors all your partners you're you're taking everybody with you and there's no evidence uh of a market that is really really challenging you know the fact that the technology can solve problems and the fact that you have research papers that that are used that that are made possible because of it are interesting but you're always looking for that market but nonetheless before a market exists you still need early indicators of future success you know we we have this phrase in the company is is you know there's a phrase called key performance indicators unfortunately kpis are hard to understand I find kpis hard to understand what's a good kpi you know a lot of people you know when when we look for kpis we go gross margins that's not a kpi that's a result you know you're looking for something that's an early indicators of future positive results okay and as early as possible and the reason for that is because you want early indic that early sign that you're going in the right direction and so we have this phrase is called EO ifs FS you know early indicators e FS early indicators of future success and and um and it helps people uh uh because I was using it all the time to give the company hope that hey look we solved this problem we solved that problem we solved this problem the markets didn't exist but there were important problems and that's what the company's about to solve these problems uh we want to be sustainable and therefore the markets have to exist at some point but you you want you want to decouple the result from um uh from evidence that you're doing the right thing okay and so so so that's how you that's how you kind of solve this problem of investing into something that's very very far away um and having the the conviction uh to stay on the road is to find as early as possible the indicators that you're doing the right things and so uh start with a core belief unless something you know changes your mind you continue to believe in it and um look for early indicators of future success what are some of those early indicators that have been used by product teams at Nvidia uh all kinds um uh uh I saw I saw I saw a uh a paper uh long before I saw the paper I met some people that needed my help on on um uh on this thing called Deep learning at a time I didn't even know what deep learning Le was and um and they needed us to create a domain specific language so that um all of their algorithms could be expressed easily on our on our processors and we created this thing called cdnn and it's essentially the SQL um uh SQL is in in storage Computing this is um neuron network computing and uh we created a a language if you will domain specific language for that you know kind of like the openg GL of of uh deep learning and so we we uh they needed us to do that so that they they could express their mathematics and uh they didn't understand Cuda but they understood their deep learning and so we created this thing in the middle for them uh and the reason why we did it was because uh even though there were zero I mean this you know these researchers had no money uh and and this is kind of one of the the great skills of our company that that you're willing to do something even though the financial returns are complet completely non-existent or maybe very very far out even if you believed in it uh we we ask ourselves you know is this worthy work to do um does this Advance a field of science somewhere that matters notice this is something that I I've been talking about you know since the very beginning of time uh we ex we we find inspiration uh not from the size of a market from but from the importance of the work uh because the importance of the work is the early indicators of a future Market and nobody has to write a nobody has to do a a um a business case on it nobody has to show me a a pnl uh nobody has to show me a financial forecast the only question is is this important work and if we didn't do it uh would it happen without us now if we didn't do something and something could happen without us it gives me tremendous Joy actually and the reason for that is could you imagine the world got better you didn't have to lift a finger that's the definition of you know of of uh ultimate laziness and and and in a lot of ways in a lot of ways you want that habit and the reason for that is this uh you want the company to be lazy about doing things that other people always do can do if somebody else can do it let them do it we should go select the things that if we didn't do it the world the world would fall apart you have to convince yourself of that that if I don't do this it won't get done that is Inc and and if that work is hard and that work is impactful and important then it gives you a sense of purpose does that make sense and so our company has been selecting these projects deep learning was just one of them and the first indicator of of the success of that was this you know fuzzy cat that that Andrew an came up with and um then Alex kvki uh detected cats um you know not all the time but you know successfully enough that it was you know this might take us somewhere and then we reasoned about the structure of deep learning and you know we're computer scientists and we understand how things work and and so we we uh we convinced ourselves this could change everything and and um and anyhow that but that's an that's an example so these selections that you've made they've paid huge dividends both literally and figuratively um but you've had to steer the company through some very challenging times like when it lost 80% of its market cap amid the financial crisis cuz what Wall Street didn't believe in your bet on ML um in times like these how do you steer the company and keep the employees motivated at the task at hand uh it's this is the my reaction during that time is the same reaction I had about this week uh earlier today you asked me about this week my pulse was exactly the same this week is no different than last week or the week before that um and so the opposite of that you know when you drop it 80% um it don't get me wrong when when your share price drops 80% it's a little embarrassing okay and and um you just want to you just want to wear a t-shirt that says wasn't my fault um but even more than that you just you just don't want to you you don't want to get out of your bed you don't want to leave the house um all of that is true all of that is true um but then you go back to go back to just doing your job I woke up at the same time I prioritize my day in the same way uh I go back to what do I believe uh you got to gut check always gut check back to the court you know what do you believe uh what are the most important things uh and uh just check them off you know sometimes sometimes it's helpful to you know family loves me okay check um you know double you know right and so you just got to check it off and and you go back to your core um and then go back to work and and then every conversations go back to the core uh keep the company focused back on the core do you believe in it did something change the stock price changed but did something else change the physics change the gravity change did did all of the things that that that we assumed uh that we believed that led to our decision did any of those things change because if those things change you got to change everything but if none of those things change you change nothing you keep on going yeah yeah that's how you do it in speaking with your employees they say that you try to avoid the public in speaking with your employees they've said that your leadership including the employees I'm just kidding no le lead leaders have to be seen unfortunately that's the hard that's the hard part you know I I I was I was I was at I was I was an electrical engineering student and I was quite Young when I went to school um when I went to went to College I was I was still 16 years old and so I was I was young when I did everything and and so I was a bit of an introvert kind of you know I'm shy I don't enjoy public speaking I'm delighted to be here I'm not suggesting um but but it's it's not something that I do naturally and and um I and so so when when things are challenging um uh it's not easy to be in front of precisely the people that you care most about you know and the reason for that is because could you imagine a company meeting we just our stock prices dropped by 80% and the most important thing I have to do as the CEO is this to come and face you explain it and partly you're not sure why partly you're not sure how long uh how bad yeah you just don't know these things and and but you still got to explain it face face all these people and you know what they're thinking you know you you know some of them are probably thinking we're doomed uh some people are probably thinking you're an idiot and some people are probably thinking you know something else and so I um there are a lot of things that people are thinking and you know that they're thinking those things but you still have to get in front of them and and and deal you know do the hard work they may be thinking of those things but yet not a single person of your leadership team left during times like this and in fact unemployable that's what I keep reminding them I'm just kidding I'm surrounded by Geniuses I'm surrounded by Geniuses yeah other Geniuses un un unbelievable uh Nvidia is well known to have singularly the best management team on the planet this is the deepest technology management team the world's ever seen I'm surrounded by a whole bunch of them and they're just genius business teams marketing teams sales teams just incredible and engineering teams my research teams unbelievable yeah your employees say that your leadership style is very engaged you have 50 direct reports you encourage people across all parts of the organization to send you the top five things on their mind and you constantly remind people that no task is beneath you can you tell us why you've purposefully designed such a flat organization and how should we be thinking about our organizations that we designed in the future uh no task is is to me no task is beneath me because remember I used to be a dishwasher and I and I mean that I used to clean toilets I mean you know I cleaned a lot of toilets I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined and and some of them just can't [Laughter] unsee I don't know I I don't know what to tell you you know that's life and and so so uh uh you can't show me and you can't show me a task that is that's beneath me um now I'm not doing it I'm not doing it uh only because because of uh you know whether it's beneath me or not beneath me U if you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you and in my in my review of IT share with you how I reason through it uh I've made a contribution to you I've made I've made it possible for you to see how I reason through something and and by reasoning as you know how someone reasons through something empowers you you go oh my gosh that's how you reason through something like this it's not as complicated as it seems this is how you reason through something that's super ambiguous this is how you reason through something that's incalculable this is how you reason through something that you know seems to be very scary this is how you seem do you understand and so I show people how to reason through things all the time strategy things you know how to forecast something how to break a problem down uh and you're just you're empowering people all over the place and so that's how I see it if you send me something you want me to help review it uh I'll do my best and I'll show you how I would do it um I in the process of doing that of course I learned a lot from you is that right you gave me a seat of a lot of information I learned a lot and so I I feel rewarded by the process um it does take a lot of energy sometimes because you know you got in order to add value to somebody and they're incredibly smart as a starting point and I'm surrounded by incredibly smart people you have to at least get to their plane you know you have to get into their head space and that's really hard that's really hard um and that takes just an enormous amount of emotional and intellectual energy and so I feel exhausted after after I I work on things like that um I'm surrounded by by a lot of great people a CEO should have the most direct report rep s um uh by definition because the people that reports to the CEO requires the least amount of management it makes no sense to me that CEOs have so few people reporting to them except for one fact that I know to be true the the knowledge the information of a CEO is supposedly so so valuable so secretive you can only share with two other people or three and their information is so invaluable so incredibly secretive that they can only share with a couple more well um I don't believe in in in a culture an environment where the information that you possess is the reason why you have power I would like us all to to to contribute to the company and our position in the company should have something to do with our ability to reason through complicated things lead other people to um achieve greatness um Inspire Empower other people um support other people those are the reasons why the the management team exists in service of all of the other people that work in the company to create the conditions by which all of the all of these amazing people who volunteer to come work for you instead of all the other amazing high-tech companies around the world they elected they volunteer to work for you and so you should create the conditions by which they could do their life's work which is Mission you know you probably heard it i' I've said that you know pretty clearly and I and I believe that what my job is is very simply to create the conditions by which you could do your life's work and so how do I do that what does that condition look like well that condition should um result in great deal of empowerment you should you can only be empowered if you understand the circumstance isn't it right you have to understand the cont you have to understand the context of the situation you're in in order for you to come up with great ideas and so I have to create a circumstance where you understand the context which means you have to be informed and the best way to be informed is for there to be as little layers of information mutilation right between us and so that's the reason why it's very often that I'm reasoning through things like in an audience like this I say first of all this is the beginning facts these are the data that we have um this is how I would reason through it these are some of the assumptions these are some of the unknowns these are some of the knowns and so you reason through it and now you've created an organization that's highly empowered nvidia's 30,000 people we're the smallest large company in the world we're tiny little company but every employee is so empowered and they're making smart decisions on my behalf every single day and the reason for that is because you know they understand that they understand my condition they understand my condition I'm very transparent with people um and uh and I believe that that I can trust you with the information often times the information is hard to hear and uh the the situations are complicated uh but I trust that you can handle it you're you know a lot of people hear me say you know these you're adults here you can handle this sometimes they're not really adults they just graduated I'm just kidding I know that when I first graduated was barely an adult and um I but I was I was fortunate that I was trusted with with uh with uh important information so I want to do that I want to create the conditions for people to do that I do want to now address the topic that is on everybody's mind AI last week you said that generative Ai and accelerated Computing have hit the Tipping Point so as this technology becomes more mainstream what are the applications that you personally are most excited about well you have to go back to First principles and ask yourself what is generative AI what happened um what happened was we have a we now have the ability to have software that can understand something they they can understand why you know what is first of all we digitized everything that was you know like for example Gene sequencing you digitized genes but what does it mean that sequence of genes what does it mean we've digitized amino acids um but what does it mean uh and so we now have the ability we dig digitize words we digitize sounds uh we digitize images and videos we digitize a lot of things but what does it mean we now have the ability through um a lot of study a lot of Da data and from their patterns and relationships we We Now understand what they mean not only do we understand what they mean we we can translate between them because we learned about the meaning of these things in the same world we didn't learn about them separately so we we learned about speech and and words and and paragraphs and vocabulary in the same context and so we found correlations between them and they're all you know registered if you will registered to each other and so now we uh not only do we understand uh the modality the meaning of each modality we can understand how to translate between them and so uh for obvious things you could caption video to text that's captioning uh text to uh images M Journey uh text to text chat GPT I amazing things and so so we now we now know that uh we understand meaning and we can translate uh the translation of something is generation of information and and um uh and all of a sudden you you have to take your you take a step back and ask yourself um uh what is the implication in every single layer of everything that we do and so I'm exercising in front of you I'm reasoning in front of you uh the same thing I did a quarter uh 15 years ago when I first saw um uh alexnet some 13 14 years ago I guess um I how I reasoned through it uh what did I see how interesting what can it do very cool but then most importantly what does it mean what does it mean what does it mean to every single layer of computing because you know we're in the world of computing and so what it means is that that the way that we um process information fundamentally will be different in the future that's what Nvidia builds you know chips and system the way we write software will be fundamentally different in the future the type of software we'll be able to write write in the future will be different new applications and then ALS also the processing of those applications will be different what was historically a retrieval based model where uh in uh information was pre pre-recorded if you will almost you know we wrote the text pre-recorded and we retrieved it based on uh some recommender system algorithm in the future uh some seed of information will be will be uh the starting point we call them prompts you as you guys know and then we generate the rest of it and so the future of computing will be highly generated well let me give you an example of what's happening for example uh we're having a conversation right now very little of the information I'm trans I'm conveying to you is Retreat most of it is generated it's called intelligence and so in the future we're going to have a lot more generative our computers will will perform in that way it's going to be highly generative instead of Highly retrieval based you go back and you got to ask yourself you know now for for you know entrepreneurs you got to ask yourself uh what industries will be disrupted therefore will we think about networking the same way will we think about storage the same way will we think about would we be as abusive of internet traffic as we are today probably not notice we're having a conversation right now and and I to get in my car every every question so we don't have to be as abusive of of transformation information transporting as we used to um uh what's going to be more what's going to be less uh what kind of applications you know etc etc so you can go through the entire industrial spread and ask yourself what's going to get disrupted what's going to get be different what's going to get NED you know so on so forth and and that reasoning starts from what is happening what is generative AI Foundation Al what is happening go back to First principles with all things there was something I was going to tell you about organization you asked the question and I forgot to answer it the way you create an organization by the way someday um don't worry about how other companies or charts look you start from first principles remember what an organization is designed to do the organizations of the past where there's a king you know CE and then then you have all all these you know the Royal subjects you know the Royal Court and then eaff and then you keep working your way down eventually they're employees well the reason why it was designed that way is because they they wanted the employees to have as low information as possible because their fundamental purpose of the soldiers is to die in the field of battle to die without asking questions you guys know this I don't I only have 30,000 employees I would like them none of them to die I would like them to question everything does that make sense and so the way you organize in the past and the way you organize today is very different to Second the question is what is nid what does Nvidia build an organization is designed so that we could build what it whatever it is we build better and so if we all build different things why why are we organized the same way why would why would this organizational Machinery be exactly the same irrespective of what you build it doesn't make make any sense you build computers you organize this way you build healthare Services you build exactly the same way it makes no sense whatsoever and so you had to go back to First principles just ask yourself what kind of Machinery what what is the input what is the output what are the properties of this environment you know what what is the what is the what is the forest that this animal has to live in what is this characteristics is it stable most of the time you're trying to squeeze out the last drop of water or is it changing all the time being attacked by everybody and so you got to understand you know you're the CEO your job is to architect this company that's my first job to create the conditions by which you can do your life's work and the architecture has to be right and so you have to go back to First principles and think about those things and I was fortunate that that when I was 29 years old you know I had the benefit of of of taking a step back and asking myself you know how would I build this company for the future and what would it look like and you know what's the operating system which is called culture what do we what kind of behavior do we en encourage enhance and what what do we discourage and not enhance you know so on so forth and anyways I want to save time for audience questions but um this year's theme for view from the top is redefining tomorrow and one question we've asked all of our guests is Jensen as the co-founder and CEO of Nvidia if you were to close your eyes and magically change one thing about tomorrow what would it be were we supposed to think about this in advance I I'm going to give you a horrible answer um I I don't know that it's one thing look there are a lot of things we don't control you know there are a lot of things we don't control um your job is to make a unique contribution live a life of purpose to do something that nobody else in the world would do or can do to make a unique contribution so that in the event that after you done um everybody says you know the world was better because you were here and so I think that that to me um I live I live my life kind of like this I go forward in time and I Look Backwards so you asked me a question that's exactly from a from a computer vision pose perspective exactly the opposite of how I think I never look forward from where I am I go forward in time and look backwards and the reason for that is it's easier I would look backwards and kind of read my history we did this and we did that way and we broke that prom down does that make sense and so it's a little bit like um how you guys solve problems you figure figure out what is the end result that you're looking for and you work backwards to achieve it and so I imagine Nvidia uh making a unique contribution to advancing the the future of of uh of computing which is the single most important instrument of all Humanity now it's not about our self self-importance but this is just what we're good at and it's incredibly hard to do and we believe we can make an absolute unique contribution it's taken US 31 years to be here and we're still just beginning our journey and so this is insanely hard to do and uh uh When I Look Backwards I believe that we made I believe that that we're going to be remembered as a company that kind of changed everything not because we went out and changed everything through all the things that we said but because we did this one thing that was insanely hard to do that we're incredibly good at doing that we loved doing we did for a long time I'm part of the GSP lead I graduated in 2023 so my question is how do you see see your company in the next decade as what challenges do you see your company would face and how you are positioned for that first of all can I just tell you what was going on through my head as you say what challenges the list that flew by my head was so so large uh that that I was trying to figure out what to select um now the honest truth is is that when you ask that question most of the challenges that showed up for me were technical challenges and the reason for that is because that was my morning if you were to you know chosen yesterday um it might have been Market creation challenges there are some markets that I gosh I just desperately would love to create I just can't we just do it already you know but we can't do it alone Nvidia is a technology platform company we're here in service of a whole bunch of other the companies so that they could realize if you will our hopes and dreams through them and and so some of the things that I would love I would love for the world of biology to to be at a point where it's kind of like the world of Chip design 40 years ago computer AED and design um Eda that entire industry really made possible for us today and I believe we're going to make possible for them tomorrow computer AED drug design because we're able to now represent genes and proteins and even cells now very very close to be able to represent and understand the meaning of a cell a combination of a whole bunch of genes um what is a cell mean it's kind of like what does that paragraph mean well if we could understand a a cell like we can understand a paragraph imagine what we could do and so uh so so I'm I'm anxious for that to happen you know I'm kind of excited about that uh there's some that I'm just excited about that I know we around the corner on for example uh humanoid robotics very very close around the corner and the reason for that is because if you can tokenize and understand speech why can't you tokenize and understand uh manipulation and so so these kind of computer science techniques you once you figure something out you ask yourself well if got do that why can't I do that and so I'm excited about those kind of things um and so that challenge is kind of a happy challenge uh some of the some of the other challenges some of the other challenges of course are industrial and geopolitical and they're social and and but you've heard all that stuff before these are all true you know the social issues in in the world uh the geopolitical issues in the world uh why can't we just get along uh things in the world why do I have to say those kind of things in the world um why do we have to say those things and then amplify them in the world uh why do we have to judge people so much in the world uh you you know all those things you guys all know that I don't have to say those things over again my name is Jose I'm a class of the 2023 uh from the GSB my question is uh are you worried at all about the pace at which we're developing AI um and do you believe that any sort of Regulation might be needed thank you uh yeah that's uh the answer is yes and no um we need uh you you know that the the the greatest breakthrough in uh modern AI of course deep learning and it enabled great progress but another incredible breakthrough is something that that humans know and we practice all the time uh and we just invented it for uh for language models called uh grounding reinforcement learning human feedback um I provide reinforcement learning human feedback every day that's my job um and their for their parents in the room uh you're providing reinforcement learning human feedback all the time okay now we just figured out how to do that um at a system systematic level for artificial intelligence there are a whole bunch of other technology necessary to uh guardrail uh fine-tune ground for example how do I generate um how do I generate uh uh uh tokens that obey the laws of physics you know right now things are floating in space and doing things and they don't they don't obey the laws of physics um how do that requires technology Guard railing requires technology fine-tuning requires technology alignment requires technology safety requires technology the reason why planes are so safe is because you know all of the autopilot systems are are surrounded by diversity and redundancy and all kinds of different functional safety and active safety systems that were invented I need all of that to be invented much much faster uh you also know that that the border between security and artificial intelligence cyber security and artificial intelligence is going to become blurry and blurry we need technology to advance very very quickly in the area of cyber security in in order to protect us from artificial intelligence and so so in a lot of ways we need technology to go faster a lot faster okay uh regulation there's two types of Regulation uh there's social regulation I don't know what to do about that but there's product and services regulation know exactly what to do about that okay so um the fa the FAA the FDA the uh Nitsa you name it all the the fs and all the NS and all the you know fcc's the they all have regulations for products and services that are have particular use cases uh um uh bar exams and doctors and you know so on so forth um you all have uh qual qualification exams you all have standards that you have to reach you all have to uh continuously be certified uh accountants and so on so forth whether it's a product or a service there are lots and lots of regulations please do not add a super regulation that cuts across of it the regulator who is regulating accounting should not be the regulator that regulates a doctor you know I love accountants um but I I just you know if I ever need an open heart surgery the fact that they can close books is interesting but not sufficient and so and so I I would like I would like um all of those all of those fields that already have products and services um to also enhance their regulation in context of in the context of AI okay but I left out this one very big one which is this the social implication of AI and how do you how do you deal with that I don't have great answers for that um but you know enough people are talking about it but it's important to subdivide all of this into chunks does that make sense so that we don't we don't become super hyperfocused on this one thing at the expense of a whole bunch of routine things that we could have done and as a result people are getting killed by cars and planes and you know it doesn't make any sense we should make sure that we we do the right things there okay very practical things may I take one more question well we have some rapid fire questions for you as view from the tradition okay I was trying to avoid that okay all right far away far away well your first job was at Denny's they now have a booth dedicated to you what was your fondest memory of working my second job was AMD by the way is there Booth dedicated to me there I'm just kidding um I'm I love my job there I did I love there it's a great company yeah yeah um if there were a worldwide shortage of black leather jackets what would we be see you wearing oh no I've I've got a large reservoir of black jackets I'm the I'll be the only person who is who is not concerned um you spoke a lot about textbooks if you had to write one what would it be called I wouldn't write one you're asking me a hypothetical question that has no possibility of of of uh that's fair and finally if you could share one parting piece of advice to broadcast across Stanford what would it be uh it's not a word but but um I you know have a core belief um gut check it every day I pursue it with all your might pursue it for a very long time surround yourself with people you love and take them on that right so that's the story of Nvidia Jensen this last hour has been a treat thank you for spending thank you very much [Music]

virtual scenarios to let us safely explore the real world and understand every decision I even helped write the script breathe life into the words I am AI brought to life by Nvidia deep learning and Brilliant Minds everywhere please welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Wong welcome to GTC I hope you realize this is not a concert you have arrived at a developers conference there will be a lot of science described algorithms computer architecture mathematics I sensed a very heavy weight in the room all of a sudden almost like you were in the wrong place no no conference in the world is there a great assembly of researchers from such diverse fields of science from climatech to radio Sciences trying to figure out how to use AI to robotically control MOS for Next Generation 6G radios robotic self-driving car s even artificial intelligence even artificial intelligence everybody's first I noticed a sense of relief there all of all of a sudden also this conference is represented by some amazing companies this list this is not the attendees these are the presentors and what's amazing is this if you take away all of my friends close friends Michael Dell is sitting right there in the IT industry all of the friends I grew up with in the industry if you take away that list this is what's amazing these are the presenters of the non it Industries using accelerated Computing to solve problems that normal computers can't it's represented in life sciences healthc Care genomics Transportation of course retail Logistics manufacturing industrial the gamut of Industries represented is truly amazing and you're not here to attend only you're here to present to talk about your research $100 trillion dollar of the world's Industries is represented in this room today this is absolutely amazing there is absolutely something happening there is something going on the industry is being transformed not just ours because the computer industry the computer is the single most important instrument of society today fundamental transformations in Computing affects every industry but how did we start how did we get here I made a little cartoon for you literally I drew this in one page this is nvidia's Journey started in 1993 this might be the rest of the talk 1993 this is our journey we were founded in 1993 there are several important events that happen along the way I'll just highlight a few in 2006 Cuda which has turned out to have been a revolutionary Computing model we thought it was revolutionary then it was going to be an overnight success and almost 20 years later it happened we saw it coming two decades later in 2012 alexnet Ai and Cuda made first Contact in 2016 recognizing the importance of this Computing model we invented a brand new type of computer we called the dgx one 170 Tera flops in this supercomputer eight gpus connected together for the very first time I hand delivered the very first dgx-1 to a startup located in San Francisco called open AI dgx-1 was the world's first AI supercomputer remember 170 Tera flops 2017 the Transformer arrived 2022 chat GPT capture the world's imag imaginations have people realize the importance and the capabilities of artificial intelligence and 2023 generative AI emerged and a new industry begins why why is a new industry because the software never existed before we are now producing software using computers to write software producing software that never existed before it is a brand new category it took share from nothing it's a brand new category and the way you produce the software is unlike anything we've ever done before in data centers generating tokens producing floating Point numbers at very large scale as if in the beginning of this last Industrial Revolution when people realized that you would set up factories apply energy to it and this invisible valuable thing called electricity came out AC generators and 100 years later 200 years later we are now creating new types of electrons tokens using infrastructure we call factories AI factories to generate this new incredibly valuable thing called artificial intelligence a new industry has emerged well well we're going to talk about many things about this new industry we're going to talk about how we're going to do Computing next we're going to talk about the type of software that you build because of this new industry the new software how you would think about this new software what about applications in this new industry and then maybe what's next and how can we start preparing today for what is about to come next well but before I start I want to show you the soul of Nvidia the soul of our company at the intersection of computer Graphics physics and artificial intelligence all intersecting inside a computer in Omniverse in a virtual world simulation everything we're going to show you today literally everything we're going to show you today is a simulation not animation it's only beautiful because it's physics the world is beautiful it's only amazing because it's being animated with robotics it's being animated with artificial intelligence what you're about to see all day it's completely generated completely simulated and Omniverse and all of it what you're about to enjoy is the world's first concert where everything is homemade everything is homemade you're about to watch some home videos so sit back and enjoy yourself m what a God I love it Nvidia accelerated Computing has reached the Tipping Point general purpose Computing has run out of steam we need another way of doing Computing so that we can continue to scale so that we can continue to drive down the cost of computing so that we can continue to consume more and more Computing while being sustainable accelerated Computing is a dramatic speed up over general purpose Computing and in every single industry we engage and I'll show you many the impact is dramatic but in no industry is a more important than our own the industry of using simulation tools to create products in this industry it is not about driving down the cost of computing it's about driving up the scale of computing we would like to be able to sim at the entire product that we do completely in full Fidelity completely digitally in essentially what we call digital twins we would like to design it build it simulate it operate it completely digitally in order to do that we need to accelerate an entire industry and today I would like to announce that we have some Partners who are joining us in this journey to accelerate their entire ecosystem so that we can bring the world into accelerated Computing but there's a bonus when you become accelerated your infrastructure is cou to gpus and when that happens it's exactly the same infrastructure for generative Ai and so I'm just delighted to announce several very important Partnerships there are some of the most important companies in the world and Anis does engineering simulation for what the world makes we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the ancis ecosystem to connect anus to the Omniverse digital twin incredible the thing that's really great is that the install base of media GPU accelerated systems are all over the world in every cloud in every system all over Enterprises and so the app the applications they accelerate will have a giant installed base to go serve end users will have amazing applications and of course system makers and csps will have great customer demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally first software partner they were there in very first day of our company synopsis revolutionized the chip industry with high level design we are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're accelerating computational lithography one of the most important applications that nobody's ever known about in order to make chips we have to push lithography to limit Nvidia has created a library domain specific library that accelerates computational lithography incredibly once we can accelerate and software Define all of tsmc who is announcing today that they're going to go into production with Nvidia kitho once this software defined and accelerated the next step is to apply generative AI to the future of semiconductor manufacturing push in Geometry even further Cadence builds the world's essential Eda and SDA tools we also use Cadence between these three companies ansis synopsis and Cadence we basically build Nvidia together we are cud accelerating Cadence they're also building a supercomputer out of Nvidia gpus so that their customers could do fluid Dynamic simulation at a 100 a thousand times scale basically a wind tunnel in real time Cadence Millennium a supercomputer with Nvidia gpus inside a software company building supercomputers I love seeing that building Cadence co-pilots together imagine a day when Cadence could synopsis ansis tool providers would offer you AI co-pilots so that we have thousands and thousands of co-pilot assistants helping us design chips Design Systems and we're also going to connect Cadence digital twin platform to Omniverse as you could see the trend here we're accelerating the world's CAE Eda and SDA so that we could create our future in digital Twins and we're going to connect them all to Omniverse the fundamental operating system for future digital twins one of the industries that benefited tremendously from scale and you know you all know this one very well large language model basically after the Transformer was invented we were able to scale large language models at incredible rates effectively doubling every six months now how is it possible that by doubling every six months that we have grown the industry we have grown the computational requirements so far and the reason for that is quite simply this if you double the size of the model you double the size of your brain you need twice as much information to go fill it and so every time you double your parameter count you also have to appropriately increase your training token count the combination of those two numbers becomes the computation scale you have to support the latest the state-of-the-art open AI model is approximately 1.8 trillion parameters 1.8 trillion parameters required several trillion tokens to go train so so a few trillion parameters on the order of a few trillion tokens on the order of when you multiply the two of them together approximately 30 40 50 billion quadrillion floating Point operations per second now we just have to do some Co math right now just hang hang with me so you have 30 billion quadrillion a quadrillion is like a paa and so if you had a PA flop GPU you would need 30 billion seconds to go compute to go train that model 30 billion seconds is approximately 1,000 years well 1,000 years it's worth it like to do it sooner but it's worth it which is usually my answer when most people tell me hey how long how long's it going to take to do something 20 years how it it's worth it but can we do it next week and so 1,000 years 1,000 years so what we need what we need are bigger gpus we need much much bigger gpus we recognized this early on and we realized that the answer is to put a whole bunch of gpus together and of course innovate a whole bunch of things along the way like inventing 10 censor cores advancing MV links so that we could create essentially virtually Giant gpus and connecting them all together with amazing networks from a company called melanox infiniband so that we could create these giant systems and so djx1 was our first version but it wasn't the last we built we built supercomputers all the way all along the way in 2021 we had Seline 4500 gpus or so and then in 2023 we built one of the largest AI supercomputers in the world it's just come online EOS and as we're building these things we're trying to help the world build these things and in order to help the world build these things we got to build them first we build the chips the systems the networking all of the software necessary to do this you should see these systems imagine writing a piece of software that runs across the entire system Distributing the computation across thousands of gpus but inside are thousands of smaller gpus millions of gpus to distribute work across all of that and to balance the workload so that you can get the most Energy Efficiency the best computation time keep your cost down and so those those fundamental Innovations is what got us here and here we are as we see the miracle of chat GPT emerg in front of us we also realize we have a long ways to go we need even larger models we're going to train it with multimodality data not just text on the internet but we're going to we're going to train it on texts and images and graphs and charts and just as we learn watching TV and so there's going to be a whole bunch of watching video so that these Mo models can be grounded in physics understands that an arm doesn't go through a wall and so these models would have common sense by watching a lot of the world's video combined with a lot of the world's languages it'll use things like synthetic data generation just as you and I do when we try to learn we might use our imagination to simulate how it's going to end up just as I did when I Was preparing for this keynote I was simulating it all along the way I hope it's going to turn out as well as I had it in my head as I was simulating how this keynote was going to turn out somebody did say that another performer did her performance completely on a treadmill so that she could be in shape to deliver it with full energy I I didn't do that if I get a l wind at about 10 minutes into this you know what happened and so so where were we we're sitting here using synthetic data generation we're going to use reinforcement learning we're going to practice it in our mind we're going to have ai working with AI training each other just like student teacher Debaters all of that is going to increase the size of our model it's going to increase the amount of the amount of data that we have and we're going to have to build even bigger gpus Hopper is fantastic but we need bigger gpus and so ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to a very very big GPU named after David Blackwell math ician game theorists probability we thought it was a perfect per per perfect name black wealth ladies and gentlemen enjoy this the com Blackwell is not a chip Blackwell is the name of a platform uh people think we make gpus and and we do but gpus don't look the way they used to here here's the here's the here's the the if you will the heart of the blackw system and this inside the company is not called Blackwell it's just the number and um uh this this is Blackwell sitting next to oh this is the most advanced GPU in the world in production today this is Hopper this is Hopper Hopper changed the world this is Blackwell it's okay Hopper you're you're very good good good boy well good girl 208 billion transistors and so so you could see you I can see that there's a small line between two dyes this is the first time two dieses have abutted like this together in such a way that the two chip the two dieses think it's one chip there's 10 terabytes of data between it 10 terabytes per second so that these two these two sides of the Blackwell Chip have no clue which side they're on there's no memory locality issues no cach issues it's just one giant chip and so uh when we were told that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond the limits of physics uh the engineer said so what and so this is what what happened and so this is the Blackwell chip and it goes into two types of systems the first one is form fit function compatible to Hopper and so you slide all Hopper and you push in Blackwell that's the reason why one of the challenges of ramping is going to be so efficient there are installations of Hoppers all over the world and they could be they could be you know the same infrastructure same design the power the electricity The Thermals the software identical push it right back and so this is a hopper version for the current hgx configuration and this is what the other the second Hopper looks like this now this is a prototype board and um Janine could I just borrow ladies and gentlemen Jan Paul and so this this is the this is a fully functioning board and I just be careful here this right here is I don't know10 billion the second one's five it gets cheaper after that so any customers in the audience it's okay all right but this is this one's quite expensive this is to bring up board and um and the the way it's going to go to production is like this one here okay and so you're going to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected to a Grace CPU the grace CPU has a super fast chipto chip link what's amazing is this computer is the first of its kind where this much computation first of all fits into this small of a place second it's memory coherent they feel like they're just one big happy family working on one application together and so everything is coherent within it um the just the amount of you know you saw the numbers there's a lot of terabytes this and terabytes that's um but this is this is a miracle this is a this let's see what are some of the things on here uh there's um uh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on on uh your which one is mine and your left one of them it doesn't matter uh one of them one of them is a CPU chipto chip link is my left or your depending on which side I was just I was trying to sort that out and I just kind of doesn't matter hopefully it comes plugged in so okay so this is the grace Blackwell system but there's more so it turns out it turns out all of the specs is fantastic but we need a whole lot of new features uh in order to push the limits Beyond if you will the limits of physics we would like to always get a lot more X factors and so one of the things that we did was We Invented another Transformer engine another Transformer engine the second generation it has the ability to dynamically and automatically rescale and recas numerical formats to a lower Precision whenever it can remember artificial intelligence is about probability and so you kind of have you know 1.7 approximately 1.7 time approximately 1.4 to be approximately something else does that make sense and so so the the ability for the mathematics to retain the Precision and the range necessary in that particular stage of the pipeline super important and so this is it's not just about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU it's not quite the world's not quite that simple you've got to figure out when you can use that across a computation that is thousands of gpus it's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you want to make sure that the the uh uh the training job is going going to converge and so this new Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV link it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very importantly it has computation in the network and the reason for that is because when you have so many different gpus working together we have to share our information with each other we have to synchronize and update each other and every so often we have to reduce the partial products and then rebroadcast out the partial products the sum of the partial products back to everybody else and so there's a lot of what is called all reduce and all to all and all gather it's all part of this area of synchronization and collectives so that we can have gpus working with each other having extraordinarily fast links and being able to do mathematics right in the network allows us to essentially amplify even further so even though it's 1.8 terabytes per second it's effectively higher than that and so it's many times that of Hopper the likel Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on in is approximately zero and the reason for that is because there's so many components working at the same time the statistic the probability of them working continuously is very low and so we need to make sure that whenever there is a well we checkpoint and restart as often as we can but if we have the ability to detect a weak chip or a weak note early we could retire it and maybe swap in another processor that ability to keep the utilization of the supercomputer High especially when you just spent $2 billion building it is super important and so we put in a Ras engine a reliability engine that does 100% self test in system test of every single gate every single bit of memory on the Blackwell chip and all the memory that's connected to it it's almost as if we shipped with every single chip its own Advanced tester that we CH test our chips with this is the first time we're doing this super excited about it secure AI only this conference do they clap for Ras the the uh secure AI uh obviously you've just spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating a very important Ai and the the code the intelligence of that AI is encoded in the parameters you want to make sure that on the one hand you don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get contaminated and so we now have the ability to encrypt data of course at rest but also in transit and while it's being computed it's all encrypted and so we now have the ability to encrypt and transmission and when we're Computing it it is in a trusted trusted environment trusted uh engine environment and the last thing is decompression moving data in and out of these nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really essential and so we've put in a high linee speed compression engine and effectively moves data 20 times times faster in and out of these computers these computers are are so powerful and there's such a large investment the last thing we want to do is have them be idle and so all of these capabilities are intended to keep Blackwell fed and as busy as possible overall compared to Hopper it is two and a half times two and a half times the fp8 performance for training per chip it is ALS it also has this new format called fp6 so that even though the computation speed is the same the bandwidth that's Amplified because of the memory the amount of parameters you can store in the memory is now Amplified fp4 effectively doubles the throughput this is vitally important for inference one of the things that that um is becoming very clear is that whenever you use a computer with AI on the other side when you're chatting with the chatbot when you're asking it to uh review or make an image remember in the back is a GPU generating tokens some people call it inference but it's more appropriately generation the way that Computing is done in the past was retrieval you would grab your phone you would touch something um some signals go off basically an email goes off to some storage somewhere there's pre-recorded content somebody wrote a story or somebody made an image or somebody recorded a video that record pre-recorded content is then streamed back to the phone and recomposed in a way based on a recommender system to present the information to you you know that in the future the vast majority of that content will not be retrieved and the reason for that is because that was pre-recorded by somebody who doesn't understand the context which is the reason why we have to retrieve so much content if you can be working with an AI that understands the context who you are for what reason you're fetching this information and produces the information for you just the way you like it the amount of energy we save the amount of networking bandwidth we save the amount of waste of time we save will be tremendous the future is generative which is the reason why we call it generative AI which is the reason why this is a brand new industry the way we compute is fundamentally different we created a processor for the generative AI era and one of the most important parts of it is content token generation we call it this format is fp4 well that's a lot of computation 5x the Gen token generation 5x the inference capability of Hopper seems like enough but why stop there the answer is it's not enough and I'm going to show you why I'm going to show you why and so we would like to have a bigger GPU even bigger than this one and so we decided to scale it and notice but first let me just tell you how we've scaled over the course of the last eight years we've increased computation by 1,000 times8 years 1,000 times remember back in the good old days of Moore's Law it was 2x well 5x every what 10 10x every 5 years that's easier easiest math 10x every 5 years a 100 times every 10 years 100 times every 10 years at the in the middle in the hey days of the PC Revolution one 100 times every 10 years in the last 8 years we've gone 1,000 times we have two more years to go and so that puts it in perspective the rate at which we're advancing Computing is insane and it's still not fast enough so we built another chip this chip is just an incredible chip we call it the Envy link switch it's 50 billion transistors it's almost the size of Hopper all by itself this switch ship has four MV links in it each 1.8 terabytes per second and and it has computation in as I mentioned what is this chip for if we were to build such a chip we can have every single GPU talk to every other GPU at full speed at the same time that's insane it doesn't even make sense but if you could do that if you can find a way to do that and build a system to do that that's cost effective that's cost effective how incredible would it be that we could have all these gpus connect over a coherent link so that they effectively are one giant GPU well one of one of the Great Inventions in order to make a cost effective is that this chip has to drive copper directly the seres of this chip is is just a phenomenal invention so that we could do direct drive to copper and as a result you can build a system that looks like this now this system this system is kind of insane this is one dgx this is what a dgx looks like now remember just six years ago it was pretty heavy but I was able to lift it I delivered the uh the uh first djx1 to open Ai and and the researchers there it's on you know the pictures are on the internet and uh uh and we all autographed it uh and um uh if you come to my office it's autographed there is really beautiful and but but you could lift it uh this dgx this dgx that djx by the way was 170 teraflops if you're not familiar with the numbering system that's 0.17 pedop flops so this is 720 the first one I delivered to open AI was 0.17 you could round it up to 0.2 won't make any difference but and back then was like wow you know 30 more teraflops and so this is now 720 pedop flops almost an exal flop for training and the world's first one exal flops machine in one rack just so you know there are only a couple two three exop flops machines on the planet as we speak and so this is an exop flops AI system in one single rack well let's take a look at the back of it so this is what makes it possible that's the back that's the that's the back the dgx MV link spine 130 terabytes per second goes through the back of that chassis that is more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet so we we could basically send everything to everybody within a second and so so we we have 5,000 cables 5,000 mvlink cables in total 2 miles now this is the amazing thing if we had to use Optics we would have had to use transceivers and retim and those transceivers and reers alone would have cost 20,000 watts 2 kilowatts of just transceivers alone just to drive the mvlink spine as a result we did it completely for free over mvlink switch and we were able to save the 20 kilow for computation this entire rack is 120 kilowatts so that 20 kilowatts makes a huge difference it's liquid cooled what goes in is 25° C about room temperature what comes out is 45°c about your jacuzzi so room temperature goes in jacuzzi comes out 2 liters per second we could we could sell a peripheral 600,000 Parts somebody used to say you know you guys make gpus and we do but this is what a GPU looks like to me when somebody says GPU I see this two years ago when I saw a GPU was the hgx it was 70 lb 35,000 Parts our gpus now are 600,000 parts and 3,000 lb 3,000 lb 3,000 lb that's kind of like the weight of a you know Carbon Fiber Ferrari I don't know if that's useful metric but everybody's going I feel it I feel it I get it I get that now that you mention that I feel it I don't know what's 3,000 lb okay so 3,000 lb ton and a half so it's not quite an elephant so this is what a dgx looks like now let's see what it looks like in operation okay let's imagine what is what how do we put this to work and what does that mean well if you were to train a GPT model 1.8 trillion parameter model it took it took about apparently about you know 3 to 5 months or so uh with 25,000 amp uh if we were to do it with hopper it would probably take something like 8,000 gpus and it would consume 15 megawatts 8,000 gpus on 15 megawatts it would take 90 days about 3 months and that would allows you to train something that is you know this groundbreaking AI model and this is obviously not as expensive as as um as anybody would think but it's 8,000 8,000 gpus it's still a lot of money and so 8,000 gpus 15 megawatts if you were to use Blackwell to do this it would only take 2,000 gpus 2,000 gpus same 90 days but this is the amazing part only 4 me GS of power so from 15 yeah that's right and that's and that's our goal our goal is to continuously drive down the cost and the energy they're directly proportional to each other cost and energy associated with the Computing so that we can continue to expand and scale up the computation that we have to do to train the Next Generation models well this is training inference or generation is vitally important going forward you know probably some half of the time that Nvidia gpus are in the cloud these days it's being used for token generation you know they're either doing co-pilot this or chat you know chat GPT that or um all these different models that are being used when you're interacting with it or generating IM generating images or generating videos generating proteins generating chemicals there's a bunch of gener generation going on all of that is B in the category of computing we call inference but inference is extremely hard for large language models because these large language models have several properties one they're very large and so it doesn't fit on one GPU this is Imagine imagine Excel doesn't fit on one GPU you know and imagine some application you're running on a daily basis doesn't run doesn't fit on one computer like a video game doesn't fit on one computer and most in fact do and many times in the past in hyperscale Computing many applic applications for many people fit on the same computer and now all of a sudden this one inference application where you're interacting with this chatbot that chatbot requires a supercomputer in the back to run it and that's the future the future is generative with these chatbots and these chatbots are trillions of tokens trillions of parameters and they have to generate tokens at interactive rates now what does that mean well uh three to tokens is about a word I you know the the uh you know space the final frontier these are the adventures that's like that's like 80 tokens okay I don't know if that's useful to you and so you know the art of communications is is selecting good an good analogies yeah this is this is not going well every I don't know what he's talking about never seen Star Trek and so and so so here we are we're trying to generate these tokens when you're interacting with it you're hoping that the tokens come back to you as quickly as possible and as quickly as you can read it and so the ability for Generation tokens is really important you have to paralyze the work of this model across many many gpus so that you could achieve several things one on the one hand you would like throughput because that throughput reduces the cost the overall cost per token of uh generating so your throughput dictates the cost of of uh delivering the service on the other hand you have another interactive rate which is another tokens per second where it's about per user and that has everything to do with quality of service and so these two things um uh compete against each other and we have to find a way to distribute work across all of these different gpus and paralyze it in a way that allows us to achieve both and it turns out the search search space is enormous you know I told you there's going to be math involved and everybody's going oh dear I heard some gasp just now when I put up that slide you know so so this this right here the the y axis is tokens per second data center throughput the x- axis is tokens per second interactivity of the person and notice the upper right is the best you want interactivity to be very High number of tokens per second per user you want the tokens per second of per data center to be very high the upper upper right is is terrific however it's very hard to do that and in order for us to search for the best answer across every single one of those intersections XY coordinates okay so you just look at every single XY coordinate all those blue dots came from some repartitioning of the software some optimizing solution has to go and figure out what whether to use use tensor parallel expert parallel pipeline parallel or data parallel and distribute this enormous model across all these G different gpus and sustain performance that you need this exploration space would be impossible if not for the programmability of nvidia's gpus and so we could because of Cuda because we have such Rich ecosystem we could explore this universe and find that green roof line it turns out that green roof line notice you got tp2 EPA dp4 it means two parall two uh tensor parallel tensor parallel across two gpus expert parallels across eight data parallel across four notice on the other end you got tensor parallel cross 4 and expert parallel across 16 the configuration the distribution of that software it's a different different um runtime that would produce these different results and you have to go discover that roof line well that's just one model and this is just one configuration of a computer imagine all of the models being created around the world and all the different different um uh configurations of of uh systems that are going to be available so now that you understand the basics let's take a look at inference of Blackwell compared to Hopper and this is this is the extraordinary thing in one generation because we created a system that's designed for trillion parameter gener generative AI the inference capability of Blackwell is off the charts and in fact it is some 30 times Hopper y for large language models for large language models like Chad GPT and others like it the blue line is Hopper I gave you imagine we didn't change the architecture of Hopper we just made it a bigger chip we just used the latest you know greatest uh 10 terab you know terabytes per second we connected the two chips together we got this giant 208 billion parameter chip how would we have performed if nothing else changed and it turns out quite wonderfully quite wonderfully and that's the purple line but not as great as it could be and and that's where the fp4 tensor core the new Transformer engine and very importantly the MV link switch and the reason for that is because all these gpus have to share the results partial products whenever they do all to all all all gather whenever they communicate with each other that mvlink switch is communicating almost 10 times faster than what we could do in the past using the fastest networks Okay so Blackwell is going to be just an amazing system for a generative Ai and in the future in the future data centers are going to be thought of as I mentioned earlier as an AI Factory an AI Factory's goal in life is to generate revenues generate in this case intelligence in this facility not generating electricity as in AC generator but of the last Industrial Revolution and this Industrial Revolution the generation of intelligence and so this ability is super super important the excitement of Blackwell is really off the charts you know when we first when we first um uh you know this this is a year and a half ago two years ago I guess two years ago when we first started to to go to market with hopper you know we had the benefit of of uh two two uh two csps uh joined us in a lunch and and we were you know delighted um and so we had two customers uh we have more now unbelievable excitement for Blackwell unbelievable excitement and there's a whole bunch of different configurations of course I showed you the configurations that slide into the hopper form factor so that's easy to upgrade I showed you examples that are liquid cooled that are the extreme versions of it one entire rack that's that's uh connected by mvlink 72 uh we're going to Blackwell is going to be ramping to the world's AI companies of which there are so many now doing amazing work in different modalities the csps every CSP is geared up all the OEM and odms Regional clouds Sovereign AIS and Telos all over the world are signing up to launch with Blackwell this Blackwell Blackwell would be the the the most successful product launch in our history and so I can't wait wait to see that um I want to thank I want to thank some partners that that are joining us in this uh AWS is gearing up for Blackwell they're uh they're going to build the first uh GPU with secure AI they're uh building out a 222 exf flops system you know just now when we animated uh just now the digital twin if you saw the the all of those clusters are coming down by the way that is not just art that is a digital twin of what we're building that's how big it's going to be besides infrastructure we're doing a lot of things together with AWS we're Cuda accelerating stag maker AI we're Cuda accelerating Bedrock AI uh Amazon robotics is working with us uh using Nvidia Omniverse and Isaac Sim AWS Health has Nvidia Health Integrated into it so AWS has has really leaned into accelerated Computing uh Google is gearing up for Blackwell gcp already has A1 100s h100s t4s l4s a whole Fleet of Nvidia Cuda gpus and they recently announced the Gemma model that runs across all of it uh we're work working to optimize uh and accelerate every aspect of gcp we're accelerating data proc which for data processing their data processing engine Jax xlaa vertex Ai and mojoko for robotics so we're working with uh Google and gcp across a whole bunch of initiatives uh Oracle is gearing up for black wellth Oracle is a great partner of ours for Nvidia dgx cloud and we're also working together to accelerate something that's really important to a lot of companies Oracle database Microsoft is accelerating and Microsoft is gearing up for Blackwell Microsoft Nvidia has a wide- ranging partnership we're accelerating Cuda accelerating all kinds of services when you when you chat obviously and uh AI services that are in Microsoft Azure uh it's very very likely Nvidia is in the back uh doing the inference and the token generation uh we built they built the largest Nvidia infiniband supercomputer basically a digital twin of hours or a physical twin of hours uh we're bringing the Nvidia ecosystem to Azure Nvidia djx cloud to Azure uh Nvidia Omniverse is now hosted in Azure Nvidia Healthcare is an Azure and all of it is deeply integrated and deeply connected with Microsoft fabric the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell this is what I'm about to show you most of the most of the the the uh uh uh scenes that you've seen so far of Blackwell are the are the full Fidelity design of Blackwell everything in our company has a digital twin and in fact this digital twin idea is it is really spreading and it it helps it helps companies build very complicated things perfectly the first time and what could be more exciting than creating a digital twin to build a computer that was built in a digital twin and so let me show you what wistron is doing to meet the demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing widraw one of our leading manufacturing Partners is building digital twins of Nvidia dgx and hgx factories using custom software developed with Omniverse sdks and apis for their newest Factory wraw started with a digital twin to virtually integrate their multi-ad and process simulation data into a unified view testing and optimizing layouts in this physically accurate digital environment increased worker efficency icy by 51% during construction the Omniverse digital twin was used to verify that the physical build matched the digital plans identifying any discrepancies early has helped avoid costly change orders and the results have been impressive using a digital twin helped bring wion's Factory online in half the time just 2 and 1/2 months instead of five in operation the Omniverse digital twin helps widraw rapidly Test new layouts to accommodate new processes or improve operations in the existing space and monitor real-time operations using live iot data from every machine on the production line which ultimately enabled wion to reduce End to-end Cycle Times by 50% and defect rates by 40% with Nvidia Ai and Omniverse nvidia's Global ecosystem of partners are building a new era of accelerated AI enabled digitalization that's how we that's the way it's going to be in the future we're going to manufacturing everything digitally first and then we'll manufacture it physically people ask me how did it start what got you guys so excited what was it that you saw that caused you to put it all in on this incredible idea and it's this hang on a second guys that was going to be such a moment that's what happens when you don't rehearse this as you know was first Contact 20 12 alexnet you put a cat into this computer and it comes out and it says cat and we said oh my God this is going to change everything you take 1 million numbers you take one Million numbers across three channels RGB these numbers make no sense to anybody you put it into this software and it compress it dimensionally reduce it it reduces it from a million dimensions a million Dimensions it turns it into three letters one vector one number and it's generalized you could have the cat be different cats and and you could have it be the front of the cat and the back of the cat and you look at this thing you say unbelievable you mean any cats yeah any cat and it was able to recognize all these cats and we realized how it did it systematically structurally it's scalable how big can you make it well how big do you want to make it and so we imagine that this is a completely new way of writing software and now today as you know you could have you type in the word c a and what comes out is a cat it went the other way am I right unbelievable how is it possible that's right how is it possible you took three letters and you generated a million pixels from it and it made sense well that's the miracle and here we are just literally 10 years later 10 years later where we recognize textt we recognize images we recognize videos and sounds and images not only do we recognize them we understand their meaning we understand the meaning of the text that's the reason why it can chat with you it can summarize for you it understands the text it understood not just recognizes the the English it understood the English it doesn't just recognize the pixels and understood the pixels and you can you can even condition it between two modalities you can have language condition image and generate all kinds of interesting things well if you can understand these things what else can you understand that you've digitized the reason why we started with text and you know images is because we digitized those but what else have we digitized well it turns out we digitized a lot of things proteins and genes and brain waves anything you can digitize so long as there's structure we can probably learn some patterns from it and if we can learn the patterns from it we can understand its meaning if we can understand its meaning we might be able to generate it as well and so therefore the generative AI Revolution is here well what else can we generate what else can we learn well one of the things that we would love to learn we would love to learn is we would love to learn climate we would love to learn extreme weather we would love to learn uh what how we can predict future weather at Regional scales at sufficiently high resolution such that we can keep people out of Harm's Way before harm comes extreme weather cost the world $150 billion surely more than that and it's not evenly distributed $150 billion is concentrated in some parts of the world and of course to some people of the world we need to adapt and we need to know what's coming and so we are creating Earth too a digital twin of the Earth for predicting weather we and we've made an extraordinary invention called Civ the ability to use generative AI to predict weather at extremely high resolution let's take a look as the earth's climate changes AI powered weather forecasting is allowing us to more accurately predict and track severe storms like super typhoon chanthu which caused widespread damage in Taiwan and the surrounding region in 2021 current AI forecast models can accurately predict the track of storms but they are limited to 25 km resolution which can miss important details Invidia cordi is a revolutionary new generative AI model trained on high resolution radar assimilated Warf weather forecasts and air 5 reanalysis data using cordi extreme events like chanthu can be super resolved from 25 km to 2 km resolution with 1,000 times the speed and 3,000 times the Energy Efficiency of conventional weather models by combining the speed and accuracy of nvidia's weather forecasting model forecast net and generative AI models like cordi we can explore hundreds or even thousands of kilometer scale Regional weather forecasts to provide a clear picture of the best worst and most likely impacts of a storm this wealth of information can help minimize loss of life and property damage today cordi is optimized for Taiwan but soon generative super sampling will be available as part of the in viia Earth 2 inference service for many regions across the globe the weather company has the trust a source of global weather predictions we are working together to accelerate their weather simulation first principled base of simulation however they're also going to integrate Earth to cordi so that they could help businesses and countries do Regional high resolution weather prediction and so if you have some weather prediction you'd like to know like to do uh reach out to the weather company really exciting really exciting work Nvidia Healthcare something we started 15 years ago we're super super excited about this this is an area where we're very very proud whether it's Medical Imaging or genene sequencing or computational chemistry it is very likely that Nvidia is the computation behind it we've done so much work in this area today we're announcing that we're going to do something really really cool imagine all of these AI models that are being used to generate images and audio but instead of images and audio because it understood images and audio all the digitization that we've done for genes and proteins and amino acids that digitalization capability is now now passed through machine learning so that we understand the language of Life the ability to understand the language of Life of course we saw the first evidence of it with alphafold this is really quite an extraordinary thing after Decades of painstaking work the world had only digitized and reconstructed using cor electron microscopy or Crystal XR x-ray crystallography um these different techniques painstaking reconstructed the protein 200,000 of them in just what is it less than a year or so Alpha fold has reconstructed 200 million proteins basically every protein every of every living thing that's ever been sequenced this is completely revolutionary well those models are incredibly hard to use um for incredibly hard for people to build and so what we're going to do is we're going to build them we're going to build them for uh the the researchers around the world and it won't be the only one there'll be many other models that we create and so let me show you what we're going to do with it virtual screening for new medicines is a computationally intractable problem existing techniques can only scan billions of compounds and require days on thousands of standard compute nodes to identify new drug candidates Nvidia biion Nemo Nims enable a new generative screening Paradigm using Nims for protein structure prediction with Alpha fold molecule generation with MIM and docking with diff dock we can now generate and Screen candidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM can connect to custom applications to steer the generative process iteratively optimizing for desired properties these applications can be defined with biion Nemo microservices or built from scratch here a physics based simulation optimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to a Target protein while optimizing for other favorable molecular properties in parallel MIM generates high quality drug-like molecules that bind to the Target and are synthesizable translating to a higher probability of developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with Nims providing OnDemand microservices that can be combined to build powerful drug Discovery workflows like denovo protein design or ided molecule generation for virtual screening bio Nims are helping researchers and developers reinvent computational drug design Nvidia M MIM MIM cord diff there's a whole bunch of other models whole bunch of other models computer vision models robotics models and even of course some really really terrific open source language models these models are groundbreaking however it's hard for companies to use how would you use it how would you bring it into your company and integrate it into your workflow how would you package it up and run it remember earlier I just said that inference is an extraordinary computation problem how would you do the optimization for each and every one of these models and put together the Computing stack necessary to run that supercomputer so that you can run the models in your company and so we have a great idea we're going to invent a new way invent a new way for you to receive and operate software this software comes basically in a digital box we call it a container and we call it the Nvidia inference micr service a Nim and let me explain to you what it is a Nim it's a pre-trained model so it's pretty clever and it is packaged and optimized to run across nvidia's install base which is very very large what's inside it is incredible you have all these pre-trained state-ofthe-art open source models they could be open source they could be from one of our partners it could be created by us like Nvidia mull it is packaged up with all of its dependencies so Cuda the right version CNN the right version tensor RT llm Distributing across the multiple gpus Tred and inference server all completely packaged together it's optimized depending on whether you have a single GPU multi- GPU or multi node of gpus it's optimized for that and it's connected up with apis that are simple to use now this think about what an AI API is an AI API is an interface that you just talk to and so this is a piece of software in the future that has a really simple API and that API called human and these packages incredible bodies of software will be optimized and packaged and we'll put it on a website and you can download it you could take it with you you could run it in any Cloud you can run it in your own data center you can run in workstations if it fit and all you have to do is come to ai. nvidia.com we call it Nvidia inference microservice but inside the company we all call it Nims okay just imagine you know one of some someday there there's going to be one of these chat Bots and these chat Bots is going to just be in a Nim and you you'll uh you'll assemble a whole bunch of chat Bots and that's the way software is going to be be built someday how do we build software in the future it is unlikely that you'll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of python code or anything like that it is very likely that you assemble a team of AIS there's probably going to be a super AI that you use that takes the mission that you give it and breaks it down into an execution plan some of that execution plan could be handed off to another Nim that Nim would maybe uh understand sap the language of sap is abap it might understand service now and it go retrieve some information from their platforms it might then hand that result to another Nim who that goes off and does some calculation on it maybe it's an optimization software a combinatorial optimization algorithm maybe it's uh you know some just some basic calculator maybe it's pandas to do some numerical analysis on it and then it comes back with its answer and it gets combined with everybody else's and it because it's been presented with this is what the right answer should look like it knows what answer what an what right answers to produce and it presents it to you we can get a report every single day at you know top of the hour uh that has something to do with a bill plan or some forecast or uh some customer alert or some bugs database or whatever it happens to be and we could assemble it using all these Nims and because these Nims have been packaged up and ready to work on your systems so long as you have video gpus in your data center in the cloud this this Nims will work together as a team and do amazing things and so we decided this is such a great idea we're going to go do that and so Nvidia has Nims running all over the company we have chatbots being created all over the place and one of the mo most important chatbots of course is a chip designer chatbot you might not be surprised we care a lot about building chips and so we want to build chatbots AI co-pilots that are co-designers with our engineers and so this is the way we did it so we got ourselves a llama llama 2 this is a 70b and it's you know packaged up in a NM and we asked it you know uh what is a CTL Well turns out CTL is an internal uh program and it has a internal proprietary language but it thought the CTL was a combinatorial timing logic and so it describes you know conventional knowledge of CTL but that's not very useful to us and so we gave it a whole bunch of new examples you know this is no different than employee onboarding an employee uh we say you know thanks for that answer it's completely wrong um and and uh and then we present to them uh this is what a CTL is okay and so this is what a CTL is at Nvidia and the CTL as you can see you know CTL stands for compute Trace Library which makes sense you know we were tracing compute Cycles all the time and it wrote the program isn't that amazing and so the productivity of our chip designers can go up this is what you can do with a Nim first thing you can do with is customize it we have a service called Nemo microservice that helps you curate the data preparing the data so that you could teach this on board this AI you fine-tune them and then you guardrail it you can even evaluate the answer evaluate its performance against um other other examples and so that's called the Nemo micr service now the thing that's that's emerging here is this there are three elements three pillars of what we're doing the first pillar is of course inventing the technology for um uh AI models and running AI models and packaging it up for you the second is to create tools to help you modify it first is having the AI technology second is to help you modify it and third is infrastructure for you to fine-tune it and if you like deploy it you could deploy it on our infrastructure called dgx cloud or you can employ deploy it on Prem you can deploy it anywhere you like once you develop it it's yours to take anywhere and so we are effectively an AI Foundry we will do for you and the industry on AI what tsmc does for us building chips and so we go to it with our go to tsmc with our big Ideas they manufacture and we take it with us and so exactly the same thing here AI Foundry and the three pillar ERS are the NIMS Nemo microservice and dgx Cloud the other thing that you could teach the Nim to do is to understand your proprietary information remember inside our company the vast majority of our data is not in the cloud it's inside our company it's been sitting there you know being used all the time and and gosh it's it's basically invidious intelligence we would like to take that data learn its meaning like we learned the meaning of almost anything else that we just talked about learn its meaning and then reindex that knowledge into a new type of database called a vector database and so you essentially take structured data or unstructured data you learn its meaning you encode its meaning so now this becomes an AI database and that AI database in the future once you create it you can talk to it and so let me give you an example of what you could do so suppose you create you get you got a whole bunch of multi modality data and one good example of that is PDF so you take the PDF you take all of your PDFs all the all your favorite you know the stuff that that is proprietary to you critical to your company you can encode it just as we encoded pixels of a cat and it becomes the word cat we can encode all of your PDF and it turns into vectors that are now stored inside your vector database it becomes the proprietary information of your company and once you have that proprietary information you can chat to it it's an it's a smart database and so you just ch chat with data and how how much more enjoyable is that you know we for for our software team you know they just chat with the bugs database you know how many bugs was there last night um are we making any progress and then after you're done talking to this uh bugs database you need therapy and so so we have another chatbot for you you can do it okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the reason for that is because ultimately it's job is to go retrieve information as quickly as possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve me this information it goes if brings it back to you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay and so we call it the Nemo retriever well the Nemo service helps you create all these things and we have all all these different Nims we even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel your AI care manager okay so so it's a really short clip but there were so many videos to show you I guess so many other demos to show you and so I I had to cut this one short but this is Diana she is a digital human Nim and and uh you just talked to her and she's connected in this case to Hippocratic ai's large language model for healthcare and it's truly amazing she is just super smart about Healthcare things you know and so after you're done after my my Dwight my VP of software engineering talks to the chatbot for bugs database then you come over here and talk to Diane and and so so uh Diane is is um completely animated with AI and she's a digital human uh there's so many companies that would like to build they're sitting on gold mines the the Enterprise IT industry is sitting on a gold mine it's a gold mine because they have so much understanding of of uh the way work is done they have all these amazing tools that have been created over the years and they're sitting on a lot of data if they could take that gold mine and turn them into co-pilots these co-pilots could help us do things and so just about every it franchise it platform in the world that has valuable tools that people use is sitting on a gold mine for co-pilots and they would like to build their own co-pilots and their own chatbots and so we're announcing that Nvidia AI foundary is working with some of the world's great companies sap generates 87% of the world's Global Commerce basically the world runs on sap we run on sap Nvidia and sap are building sap Jewel co-pilots uh using Nvidia Nemo and dgx cloud service now they run 80 85% of the world's Fortune 500 companies run their people and customer service operations on service now and they're using Nvidia AI Foundry to build service now uh assist virtual assistance cohesity backs up the world's data they're sitting on a gold mine of data hundreds of exobytes of data over 10,000 companies Nvidia AI Foundry is working with them helping them build their Gaia generative AI agent snowflake is a company that stores the world's uh digital Warehouse in the cloud and serves over 3 billion queries a day for 10,000 Enterprise customers snowflake is working with Nvidia AI Foundry to build co-pilots with Nvidia Nemo and Nims net apppp nearly half of the files in the world are stored on Prem on net apppp Nvidia AI Foundry is helping them uh build chat Bots and co-pilots like those Vector databases and retrievers with Nvidia neemo and Nims and we have a great partnership with Dell everybody who everybody who is building these chat Bots and generative AI when you're ready to run it you're going to need an AI Factory and nobody is better at Building end-to-end Systems of very large scale for the Enterprise than Dell and so anybody any company every company will need to build AI factories and it turns out that Michael is here he's happy to take your order ladies and gentlemen Michael del okay let's talk about the next wave of Robotics the next wave of AI robotics physical AI so far all of the AI that we've talked about is one computer data comes into one computer lots of the world's if you will experience in digital text form the AI imitates Us by reading a lot of the language to predict the next words it's imitating You by studying all of the patterns and all the other previous examples of course it has to understand context and so on so forth but once it understands the context it's essentially imitating you we take all of the data we put it into a system like dgx we compress it into a large language model trillions and trillions of parameters become billions and billion trillions of tokens becomes billions of parameters these billions of parameters becomes your AI well in order for us to go to the next wave of AI where the AI understands the physical world we're going to need three computers the first computer is still the same computer it's that AI computer that now is going to be watching video and maybe it's doing synthetic data generation and maybe there's a lot of human examples just as we have human examples in text form we're going to have human examples in articulation form and the AIS will watch us understand what is happening and try to adapt it for themselves into the context and because it can generalize with these Foundation models maybe these robots can also perform in the physical world fairly generally so I just described in very simple terms essentially what just happened in large language models except the chat GPT moment for robotics may be right around the corner and so we've been building the end to-end systems for robotics for some time I'm super super proud of the work we have the AI system dgx we have the lower system which is called agx for autonomous systems the world's first robotics processor when we first built this thing people are what are you guys building it's a s so it's one chip it's designed to be very low power but it's designed for high-speed sensor processing and Ai and so if you want to run Transformers in a car or you want to run Transformers in a in a you know anything um that moves uh we have the perfect computer for you it's called the Jetson and so the dgx on top for training the AI the Jetson is the autonomous processor and in the middle we need another computer whereas large language models have the benefit of you providing your examples and then doing reinforcement learning human feedback what is the reinforcement learning human feedback of a robot well it's reinforcement learning physical feedback that's how you align the robot that's how you that's how the robot knows that as it's learning these articulation capabilities and manipulation capabilities it's going to adapt properly into the laws of physics and so we need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot we call that virtual world Omniverse and the computer that runs Omniverse is called ovx and ovx the computer itself is hosted in the Azure Cloud okay and so basically we built these three things these three systems on top of it we have algorithms for every single one now I'm going to show you one super example of how Ai and Omniverse are going to work together the example I'm going to show you is kind of insane but it's going to be very very close to tomorrow it's a robotics building this robotics building is called a warehouse inside the robotics building are going to be some autonomous systems some of the autonomous systems are going to be called humans and some of the autonomous systems are going to be called forklifts and these autonomous systems are going to interact with each other of course autonomously and it's going to be overlooked upon by this Warehouse to keep everybody out of Harm's Way the warehouse is essentially an air traffic controller and whenever it sees something happening it will redirect traffic traffic and give New Way points just new way points to the robots and the people and they'll know exactly what to do this warehouse this building you can also talk to of course you could talk to it hey you know sap Center how are you feeling today for example and so you could ask the same the warehouse the same questions basically the system I just described will have Omniverse Cloud that's hosting the virtual simulation and AI running on djx cloud and all of this is running in real time let's take a look the future of heavy industri starts as a digital twin the AI agents helping robots workers and infrastructure navigate unpredictable events in complex industrial spaces will be built and evaluated first in sophisticated digital twins this Omniverse digital twin of a 100,000 ft Warehouse is operating as a simulation environment that integrates digital workers amrs running the Nvidia Isaac receptor stack centralized activity maps of the entire Warehouse from 100 simulated ceiling mount cameras using Nvidia metropolis and AMR route planning with Nvidia Koop software in Loop testing of AI agents in this physically accurate simulated environment enables us to evaluate and refine how the system adapts to real world unpredictability here an incident occurs along this amr's planned route blocking its path as it moves to pick up a pallet Nvidia Metropolis updates and sends a realtime occupancy map to kopt where a new optimal route is calculated the AMR is enabled to see around corners and improve its Mission efficiency with generative AI powered Metropolis Vision Foundation models operators can even ask questions using natural language the visual model understands nuanced activity and can offer immediate insights to improve operations all of the sensor data is created in simulation and passed to the real-time AI running as Nvidia inference microservices or Nims and when the AI is ready to be deployed in the physical twin the real Warehouse we connect metropolis and Isaac Nims to real sensors with the ability for continuous Improvement of both the digital twin and the AI models isn't that incredible and so remember remember a future facility Warehouse Factory building will be software defined and so the software is running how else would you test the software so you you you test the software to building the warehouse the optimization system in the digital twin what about all the robots all of those robots you are seeing just now they're all running their own autonomous robotic stack and so the way you integrate software in the future cicd in the future for robotic systems is with digital twins we've made Omniverse a lot easier to access we're going to create basically Omniverse Cloud apis four simple API and a channel and you can connect your application to it so this is this is going to be as wonderfully beautifully simple in the future that Omniverse is going to be and with these apis you're going to have these magical digital twin capability we also have turned om ver into an AI and integrated it with the ability to chat USD the the language of our language is you know human and Omniverse is language as it turns out is universal scene description and so that language is rather complex and so we've taught our Omniverse uh that language and so you can speak to it in English and it would directly generate USD and it would talk back in USD but Converse back to you in English you could also look for information in this world semantically instead of the world being encoded semantically in in language now it's encoded semantically in scenes and so you could ask it of of uh certain objects or certain conditions and certain scenarios and it can go and find that scenario for you it also can collaborate with you in generation you could design some things in 3D it could simulate some things in 3D or you could use AI to generate something in 3D let's take a look at how this is all going to work we have a great partnership with Seamans Seamans is the world's largest industrial engineering and operations platform you've seen now so many different companies in the industrial space heavy Industries is one of the greatest final frontiers of it and we finally now have the Necessary Technology to go and make a real impact seens is building the industrial metaverse and today we're announcing that Seamans is connecting their Crown Jewel accelerator to Nvidia Omniverse let's take a look seens technology is transformed every day for everyone team Center acts our leading product life cycle management software from the sems accelerator platform is used every day by our customers to develop and deliver products at scale now we are bringing the real and the digital worlds even Closer by integrating Nvidia Ai and Omniverse Technologies into team Center X Omniverse apis enable data interoperability and physics-based rendering to Industrial scale design and Manufacturing projects our customers HD market leader in sustainable ship manufacturing builds ammonia and hydrogen power chips often comprising over 7 million discrete Parts with Omniverse apis team Center X lets companies like HD yundai unify and visualize these massive engineering data sets interactively and integrate generative AI to generate 3D objects or HDR I backgrounds to see their projects in context the result an ultra inuitive photoal physics-based digital twin that eliminates waste and errors delivering huge savings in cost and time and we are building this for collaboration whether across more semens accelerator tools like seens anex or Star CCM Plus or across teams working on their favorite devices in the same scene together in this is just the beginning working with Nvidia we will bring accelerated Computing generative Ai and Omniverse integration across the Sean accelerator portfolio the pro the the professional the professional voice actor happens to be a good friend of mine Roland Bush who happens to be the CEO of seens once you get Omniverse connected into your workflow your ecosystem from the beginning of your design to engineering to manufacturing planning all the way to digital twin operations once you connect everything together it's insane how much productivity you can get and it's just really really wonderful all of a sudden everybody is operating on the same ground truth you don't have to exchange data and convert data make mistakes everybody is working on the same ground truth from the design Department to the art Department the architecture Department all the way to the engineering and even the marketing department let's take a look at how Nissan has integrated Omniverse into their workflow and it's all because it's connected by all these wonderful tools and these developers that we're working with take a look unbel for for that was not an animation that was Omniverse today we're announcing that Omniverse Cloud streams to The Vision Pro and it is very very strange that you walk around virtual doors when I was getting out of that car and everybody does it it is really really quite amazing Vision Pro connected to Omniverse portals you into Omniverse and because all of these CAD tools and all these different design tools are now integrated and connected to Omniverse you can have this type of workflow really incredible let's talk about robotics everything that moves will be robotic there's no question about that it's safer it's more convenient and one of the largest Industries is going to be Automotive we build the robotic stack from top to bottom as I was mentioned from the computer system but in the case of self-driving cars including the self-driving application at the end of this year or I guess beginning of next year we will be shipping in Mercedes and then shortly after that jlr and so these autonomous robotic systems are software defined they take a lot of work to do has computer vision has obviously artificial intelligence control and planning all kinds of very complicated technology and takes years to refine we're building the entire stack however we open up our entire stack for all of the automotive industry this is just the way we work the way we work in every single industry we try to build as much of it as we can so that we understand it but then we open it up so everybody can access it whether you would like to buy just our computer which is the world's only full functional save asld system that can run AI this functional safe asld quality computer or the operating system on top or of course our data centers which is in basically every AV company in the world however you would like to enjoy it we're delighted by it today we're announcing that byd the world's largest ev company is adopting our next Generation it's called Thor Thor is designed for Transformer engines Thor our next Generation AV computer will be used by byd you probably don't know this fact that we have over a million robotics developers we created Jetson this robotics computer we're so proud of it the amount of software that goes on top of it is insane but the reason why we can do it at all is because it's 100% Cuda compatible everything that we do everything that we do in our company is in service of our developers and by us being able to maintain this Rich ecosystem and make it compatible with everything that you access from us we can bring all of that incredible capability to this little tiny computer we call Jetson a robotics computer we also today are announcing this incredibly Advanced new SDK we call it Isaac perceptor Isaac perceptor most most of the Bots today are pre-programmed they're either following rails on the ground digital rails or theyd be following April tags but in the future they're going to have perception and the reason why you want that is so that you could easily program it you say would you like to go from point A to point B and it will figure out a way to navigate its way there so by only programming waypoints the entire route could be adaptive the entire environment could be reprogrammed just as I showed you at the very beginning with the warehouse you can't do that with pre-programmed agvs if those boxes fall down they just all gum up and they just wait there for somebody to come clear it and so now with the Isaac perceptor we have incredible state-of-the-art Vision odometry 3D reconstruction and in addition to 3D reconstruction depth perception the reason for that is so that you can have two modalities to keep an eye on what's happening in the world Isaac perceptor the most used robot today is the manipulator manufacturing arms and they are also pre-programmed the computer vision algorithms the AI algorithms the control and path planning algorithms that are geometry aware incredibly computational intensive we have made these Cuda accelerated so we have the world's first Cuda accelerated motion planner that is geometry aware you put something in front of it it comes up with a new plan and our articulates around it it has excellent perception for pose estimation of a 3D object not just not it's pose in 2D but it's pose in 3D so it has to imagine what's around and how best to grab it so the foundation pose the grip foundation and the um articulation algorithms are now available we call it Isaac manipulator and they also uh just run on nvidia's computers we are are starting to do some really great work in the next generation of Robotics the next generation of Robotics will likely be a humanoid robotics we now have the Necessary Technology and as I was describing earlier the Necessary Technology to imagine generalized human robotics in a way human robotics is likely easier and the reason for that is because we have a lot more imitation training data that we can provide there robots because we are constructed in a very similar way it is very likely that the human robotics will be much more useful in our world because we created the world to be something that we can interoperate in and work well in and the way that we set up our workstations and Manufacturing and Logistics they were designed for for humans they were designed for people and so these human robotics will likely be much more productive to deploy while we're creating just like we're doing with the others the entire stack starting from the top a foundation model that learns from watching video human IM human examples it could be in video form it could be in virtual reality form we then created a gym for it called Isaac reinforcement learning gym which allows the humanoid robot to learn how to adapt to the physical world and then an incredible computer the same computer that's going to go into a robotic car this computer will run inside a human or robot called Thor it's designed for Transformer engines we've combined several of these into one video this is something that you're going to really love take a look it's not enough for humans to imagine we have to invent and explore real and push Beyond what's been done fair amount of detail we create smarter and faster we push it to fail so it can learn we teach it then help it teach itself we broaden its understanding to take on new challenges with absolute precision and succeed we make it perceive and move and even reason so it can share our world with us this is where inspiration leads us the next Frontier this is Nvidia Project Groot a general purpose Foundation model for humanoid robot learning the group model takes multimodal instructions and past interactions as input and produces the next action for the robot to execute we developed Isaac lab a robot learning application to train gr on Omniverse Isaac Sim and we scale out with osmo a new compute orchestration service that coordinates work flows across dgx systems for training and ovx systems for simulation with these tools we can train Groot in physically based simulation and transfer zero shot to the real world the Groot model will enable a robot to learn from a handful of human demonstrations so it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us this is made possible with nvidia's technologies that can understand humans from videos train models and simulation and ultimately deploy them directly to physical robots connecting group to a large language model even allows it to generate motions by following natural language instructions hi go1 can you give me a high five sure thing let's high five can you give us some cool moves sure check this out all this incredible intelligence is powered by the new Jetson Thor robotics chips designed for Groot built for the future with Isaac lab osmo and Groot we're providing the building blocks for the next generation of AI powered robotics about the same size the soul of Nvidia the intersection of computer Graphics physics artificial intelligence it all came to bear at this moment the name of that project general robotics 003 I know super good super good well I think we have some special guests do we hey guys so I understand you guys are powered by Jetson they're powered by Jetson little Jetson robotics computers inside they learn to walk in Isaac Sim ladies and gentlemen this this is orange and this is the famous green they are the bdx robots of Disney amazing Disney research come on you guys let's wrap up let's go five things where you going I sit right here Don't Be Afraid come here green hurry up what are you saying no it's not time to eat it's not time to I'll I'll give you a snack in a moment let me finish up real quick come on green hurry up stop wasting time five things five things first a new Industrial Revolution every data center should be accelerated a trillion dollars worth of installed data centers will become modernized over the next several years second because of the computational capability we brought to bear a new way of doing software has emerged generative AI which is going to create new in new infrastructure dedicated to doing one thing and one thing only not for multi-user data centers but AI generators these AI generation will create incredibly valuable software a new Industrial Revolution second the computer of this revolution the computer of this generation generative AI trillion parameters blackw insane amounts of computers and computing third I'm trying to concentrate good job third new computer new computer creates new types of software new type of software should be distributed in a new way so that it can on the one hand be an endpoint in the cloud and easy to use but still allow you to take it with you because it is your intelligence your intelligence should be pack packaged up in a way that allows you to take it with you we call them Nims and third these Nims are going to help you create a new type of application for the future not one that you wrote completely from scratch but you're going to integrate them like teams create these applications we have a fantastic capability between Nims the AI technology the tools Nemo and the infrastructure dgx cloud in our AI Foundry to help you create proprietary applications proprietary chat Bots and then lastly everything that moves in the future will be robotic you're not going to be the only one and these robotic systems whether they are humanoid amrs self-driving cars forklifts manipulating arms they will all need one thing Giant stadiums warehouses factories there can to be factories that are robotic orchestrating factories uh manufacturing lines that are robotics building cars that are robotics these systems all need one thing they need a platform a digital platform a digital twin platform and we call that Omniverse the operating system of the robotics World these are the five things that we talked about today what does Nvidia look like what does Nvidia look like when we talk about gpus there's a very different image that I have when I when people ask me about gpus first I see a bunch of software stacks and things like that and second I see this this is what we announce to you today this is Blackwell this is the plat amazing amazing processors MV link switches networking systems and the system design is a miracle this is Blackwell and this to me is what a GPU looks like in my mind listen orange green I think we have one more treat for everybody what do you think should we okay we have one more thing to show you roll it he m yeah thank you thank you have a great have a great GTC thank you all for coming thank you Build me car on an empty road. Hello, I'm James, a digital human. Feel free to ask me anything about NVIDIAand its products. Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats and welcome to the stage, NVIDIA Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. Hello, Japan! Hello, Japan. Welcome to NVIDIA AI Summit. Everything you saw just now was simulated. Everything was simulation. No animation. At the core, NVIDIA is asimulation technology company. We simulate physics. We simulate virtual worlds, we simulate intelligence. Through our simulations, we help you predict the future. So in many ways, NVIDIA builds time machines. Today we're going to talk to youabout some of our latest breakthroughs. But most importantly, this is an eventabout the Japan ecosystem. We have so many partners here. 350 startups, 250,000 developers, hundreds of companies. We've been cominghere for a very long time. Japan has been very dear to ussince the very early foundings of our company. It is here in Japan we did many firsts,many firsts for NVIDIA. It was our first game developerthat worked with us. SEGA, Yu Suzuki, the famous developer, 3D game developer,who first worked with us to port SEGA's incredible3D games to NVIDIA's GPUs. It was the first time that someone used NVIDIA CUDAto build a supercomputer. The Tsubame 1.2 at Tokyo Tech, which enabled NVIDIAto utilize our GPUs to advance scientific computing. Japan has been first in so many ways. It was also the first time thatwe were able to create mobile processors, which led to one of our very, very dear projects,the Nintendo Switch. So many firsts. Now we're in the beginning of a new age. The AI revolution: a new industry,extraordinary technology changes. This is a time that is very exciting,but it's also very critical. So we're here to partnerwith the Japan ecosystem, the amazing companies here,to bring AI to Japan. So that we can all together take advantage of thisextraordinary opportunity ahead of us. We have many partners here todaythat I would like to thank GMO Internet Group,Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, MITSUI and Companyare the platinum sponsors. I want to thank all of you for that. Thank you. And 56 other sponsors. Thank you all for comingand thank you for supporting us. NVIDIA invented accelerated computing. Accelerated computing does not replace the CPU. In fact, we were just about the only companyin computing who did not want to replace the CPU,but to augment the CPU, so that we can take the workloadsthat are very computationally intensive and offload them onto the GPU. These are GPUs, that's the CPU. Working together, we can take advantage of the bestcapabilities of both processors, one that is extremely good atsequential processing, the CPU, and a processor that's incredibly goodat parallel processing, called the GPU. This I'll talk about in just a second. But this is accelerated computing. Not just parallel computing,but accelerated computing. CPU and GPU working together. This computing model is brand new to the world. In fact, just using the CPU has been around since 1964,the year after my birth. 60 years in the making. The vast majority of everything we see in the world todayrunning on computers are running on CPUs. But there's a new change, a fundamentalchange in the computing model. But in order to do that,you cannot just take the CPU software that's running sequentiallyand put it on a GPU to run parallel. We have to create a whole bunch of newalgorithms. Just as OpenGL made it possible for computergraphics applications to connect to accelerationthrough the graphics processor, we had to create many domain-specific libraries like OpenGL,but for many different applications. These are some of the 350 different libraries we have in our company,some very, very important libraries. CuLitho was for computational lithography,takes computational lithography. Making the mask of chips may require many, many weeksbecause there are so many layers. We take many weeks of computationand reduce it down to hours. We could, of course,speed up the cycle time of building chips, but very importantly,we also make it possible to advance the algorithms of lithographymuch, much more sophisticated so that we canadvance semiconductor physics well beyond two nanometers,one nanometer and beyond. So computational lithographyis going to be accelerated by cuLitho. CuDSS for Sparse Solver, AI Aerial— I'll talk about that today. An incredible new library that makes it possiblefor this computer to run the 5G radio stack. Basically a radio in real timerunning on the CUDA accelerator. CUDA-Q for quantum simulation, quantumcircuit simulations, Parabricks for gene sequencing, cuVS for vector storage,or vector databases for indexing and queryingvector databases that is used for AI. CuPyNumeric is a numerical processing library. NumPy is the most popularnumerical processing library in the world. Five million different developers use it. It has been downloaded 30 million timesjust last month. Incredible number of downloads. It is now fully accelerated for multi-GPUmulti-node. CuPyNumeric, please go look it up.It's incredible. CuDF for data frame processing, structured data processinglike SQL, Pandas, Polars. CuOPT, the classic incredibly complicatedtraveling salesperson problem. This problem has now been acceleratedfor CuOPT, hundreds of times faster. Modulus for AI physics, and then one of the most importantlibraries we ever created, called cuDNN. CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes CuDNN for deepneural networks, which processes the different layers, the various layersof the deep learning stack. It enabled usto do something extraordinary. By creating cuDNN, and acceleratingand democratizing deep learning, we made it possible in the last decade to scale artificial intelligence and scale machine learning by 1 million times. Increasing the scale of machine learningby 1 million times enabled, of course, the incredible breakthroughthat we now know—ChatGPT. The advent of artificial intelligence. CuDNN did something very special. It enabled a change in the way that software is done. This is the way that software was donebefore. Software 1.0. Software programmers writing code to describe an algorithm—that's a function. That function is software. You then apply input, it predicts an output. That code written by human runsbest on CPUs. Software 1.0 was coding, writing software that runs on CPUs. Software 2.0, because the computer is now so incredibly fast, you can give it an enormous amount of examples—observed data— so that it can learn, it can predictwhat the function is by itself. We call that software 2.0. So instead of coding,it is now machine learning. Instead of code running on CPU,it is now neural networks running on GPUs. And neural networks, these neural networksthat are running on GPUs is now the formation of a new operating system, a new way of using computers. The operating system of the moderncomputer, Large Language Models. This machine learning approach has proven to be incredibly scalable. You can use it for all kinds of things. Of course, digitized text, languages, of course, digitized sound,speech, images, video. It could be multimodal. You could teach it amino acid sequences. You could teach it to understandjust about anything, anything where you have large observed data. Well, that was the first step, was to understandthe meaning of the data. Just by studying an enormousamount of text on the internet, we were able to understand the words, the vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and even the meaning of the words. by finding patterns and relationships. Using the same approach, we're now able to not only understand the meaningof the different data types, connect it to different modalities—for example words and images. Connect the image of the word 'cat' and the image of a catare now connected together, learning a multi-modality. We can now even translate and generate, so we can understand data of all kinds, and we can generate intelligent information,intelligence of all kinds. Well, if you look at all the amazing startupsthat are being created and the amazing applications that are being created,you can find it in this slide in one of the two combinations. One side to the other side, Text to text, would be summarization, question and answering, text generation, storytelling. Video to text wouldbe captioning. Image to text—image recognition. Text to images— image generation like Midjourney. Text to video—video creationlike Runway ML. All of these different combinationsare truly breakthrough. You can even have proteins to text, explain what a protein does. Text to chemicals,describe properties of a chemical that might be a successful drugfor drug discovery. You can even have video and textto machine articulation, robotics. Each one of these combinations is a new industry,new company, new application use case, incredible Cambrian explosionof the number of applications have now been created. And we're just at the beginning. One of the properties of machine learning,of course, is that the larger the brain, the more data we can teach it, the smarter it becomes. We call it the scaling law. There's every evidence that as we scale up the size of the models,the amount of training data, the effectiveness, the quality, the performanceof the intelligence improves. Every single year, the industry is scaling upthe size of the models by 2X or so, which correspondingly need 2X the data, and therefore we need 4Xthe amount of compute. The amount of computing resource necessaryto drive to the next level of artificial intelligenceis extraordinary. We call that the scaling law, the training scaling law. Pre-training is part of it, post-training is part of it. Post-training with reinforcementlearning, human feedback, reinforcement learning, AI feedback. So many different ways now of using synthetic data generationin the post-training stage. So training, pre-training,post-training is enjoying very significant scaling and we're continuingto see excellent results. Well, when Strawberry orOpenAI’s o1 was announced, it exposed the worldto a new type of inference. Inference is when you interact with the AI, just like ChatGPT. But ChatGPT is one shot. You ask it a question,you ask it to do something for you. Whatever question you have, whatever prompts you provide, through one shot,it delivers an answer. However, we know that thinking is oftentimesmore than just one shot, and thinking requires us to maybe domulti-plans, multiple potential answersthat we choose the best one from. Just like when we're thinking. We might reflect on the answerbefore we deliver the answer. Reflection. We might take a problem and break it down into step by stepby step, chain of thought. There are many different technologiesthat we've invented that makes it possible for inference to perform better and better as we apply more and more compute. Now we have the second scaling law: inference scaling law. Not just generation of the next word,but thinking, reflecting, planning. These two simultaneous scale lawsare going to require us to drive computing at extraordinary speeds. Every single time when we deliver a new generation,a new architecture, we increase the performance by X factors, but we also decrease the powerby the same X factor. We decrease the cost by the same X factor. So driving up performance is exactlythe same as reducing cost. Driving up the performance is exactlythe same as reducing energy. And so therefore as the world continuesto absorb and embrace artificial intelligence, it is our mission, it is our duty, it is our duty, to continue to drive theperformance up as fast as we can. In the process, expanding the reach of artificial intelligence,driving up its effectiveness, driving down its cost,driving down its power consumption. That's the reasonwhy we went to a one year cycle. However, AI is not a chip problem. These AI systems are enormous. This is the Blackwell system. Blackwell is the name of a GPU, but it'salso the name of this entire system. The GPU is extraordinary in itself. There are two Blackwell dies. Each Blackwell die is the largest chipthe world's ever made. 104 billion transistors made by TSMC and their mostadvanced four nanometer node. Two of these Blackwell dies are connected togetheracross 10TB/s, low energy link. Right in the middle,right there, that line, that seam. Thousands of interconnections between the two dies.Ten terabytes per second. It's connected by eight HBM3E memories from SK Hynixand from Micron. And these memories togetherrun at 8 TB/s. And 8 TB/s, these two GPUs are connected to the CPU with another low, very low energy, very energy efficient series, 1 TB/s. Each one of the GPUs are connectedthrough NVLink at 1.8 TB/s. That's a lot of terabytes per second. And the reason for thatis because this system cannot work alone. Even the most advanced computerthe world has ever made cannot work alonefor artificial intelligence. Sometimes it has to work with thousandsof other computers like this, nodes like this, together as one computer,and sometimes they have to work separately because they are respondingto a different customer, different query. So sometimes separately,sometimes as one. In order to enable the GPUs to work as one,we of course have networking, two ConnectX-7s that connect this GPU with thousands of other GPUs, but we still need this NVLink. This NVLink allows us to connect the few GPUs in one rackthat's standing behind me. That one rack behind me,that one rack is connected to, with this NVLink 5.0, 1.8TB per second, 35 times higher bandwidth than the highestbandwidth networking in the world, which allows us to connectall of these GPUs together to this NVLink switch. There are nine NVLink switches in one rack. Each rack has 72 computers like this connected through this spine. This is the NVLink spine. This is cables, copper. 50 pounds of copper, driven directly by this incredible series, incredible IO we call NVLink. They connect into, connect into the computer, into NVLink this way, and this switch connects all of these computers together as one. And so what results, are 72 of these computers connected as one large GPU. One incredibly large GPU. From the software perspective,it is just one giant chip, and these racks, these NVLinked 72 systems. This one rack. This one rack is 3,000 pounds. It is impossible to put on this stageotherwise I'd show it to you. That is 3,000 pounds and 120kW. That is, I have my my friends here. That's many, many Nintendo Switch power. It is not portable but it's very powerful. And so this is the Blackwell system. We designed this so that it can beconfigured as one superpod like this, or one entire gigantic data center with thousands and thousands of them,hopefully hundreds of thousands of them, And they're connected to themby the switches. Some of them are Quantum InfiniBand switches. If you want to have a dedicated AI factoryor a Spectrum-X, NVIDIA Spectrum-X revolutionary ethernet system that you can integrate into your existing ethernet environments. We can build AI supercomputers with these, we can integrate them into enterprisedata centers, into hyperscalers, or configure them for the edge. The Blackwell systemis not only incredibly powerful, it is also incredibly adaptable,so that it can fit into every corner of the world'scomputing infrastructure. So this is this is Blackwell. On top of Blackwell,of course, is the computer. But most importantly,without all of the software that runs on top of it, this computer is justsimply impossible to operate. When you see these computerswith all of the liquid cooling, all of the wiring,the mind will blow up. How do you programsuch an incredible computer? This is where NVIDIA's software stack,this is where all of our effort in CUDA, NCCL, all of our Megatron, Megatron-Core, all of the software that we created,TensorRT LLM, Triton, all of the software that we created overthe years integrated into the system,makes it possible for everyone, anyone, to deployAI supercomputers around the world. And then, of course, on top we have AI softwarethat makes it easy for people to build AI. And so what is AI? What is AI? We talk about AIin a lot of different ways, but I think there are two types of AIsthat will be extremely popular. And there are two mental modelsthat I think are very helpful. It's very helpful to me. The first AI is basically a digital AI worker. These AI workers can understand, they can plan and they can take action. Sometimes the digital AI workers are being asked to execute a marketing campaign, support a customer, come up with a manufacturing supplychain plan, optimize a chip, help us write software. Maybe be a research assistant, a lab assistant in the drug discovery industry. Maybe this agent you know is a tutor to the CEO. Maybe there's a tutorfor all of our employees. These AI, these digital AI workers,we call them AI agents are essentially like digital employees. And just like digital employees,you have to train them. You have to create datato welcome them to your company, teach them about your company. You train them for their particular skills, depending on what functionyou would like them to have, you evaluate themafter you're done training them to make sure that they learnedwhat they're supposed to learn, you guardrail themto make sure that they perform the job they're asked to do, and not the jobsthey're not asked to do. And of course, you operate them, you deploy them. Provide them energy from Blackwell, the AI tokens from Blackwell. And they interact with other agentsto work as a team to solve problems. Well, you're goingto see all kinds of different agents. And we created several thingsto make it easier for the ecosystem to be ableto build AI agents for companies. NVIDIA is not in the service business. And we don't create, we don't deliverfinal product, we don't deliver solutions, but we do deliver the enabling technologyto make it possible for the ecosystem to create AI, to deliver AI, to continuously improve AI. The AI agent lifecycle libraries, the lifecycle platform is called NeMo, and NeMo has libraries for each one of the stages that I mentioned,from data curation to training, to fine tuning to synthetic data generationto evaluation, to guard railing. And these libraries are integrated into workflowsand frameworks all over the world. We're working with AI startups, service providerslike Accenture and Deloitte, companies all over the world to bring thisto all of the large companies. We also work with ISVs like ServiceNow so that they can create agentsthat use ServiceNow. Today, you use ServiceNowby licensing the platform and your employees interact with the ServiceNow platformto get assistance. In the future, ServiceNow will also provide a large number of AI agentsthat you can rent. Essentially digital employees that you canrent to help you solve problems. We're working with ServiceNow,we're working with SAP, Cadence, Ansys, companiesall over the world, Snowflake, companies all over the worldso that we can all build agents that can be helpful to youin driving productivity in your company. Now, these agents are able to understand, reason, plan, take action. And these agents are collections or systems of AI models. It's not just one AI model, but a system of AI models. And NeMo helps us build those. We also create pre-trained AI models that we package up inwhat is called a NIM. And so these NIMs are microservices. They're basically AI packaged. In the old days,software was packaged in a box and they'd come delivered with CD-ROMs. Today, AI is packaged in a microservice andinside the software is smart. You could talk to the softwareand you could talk to the software because it understands what you mean,and you can connect the software with other software. You can connect thisAI with other AI, and together you could createessentially an agent, an AI agent. So this is the first thing. Let me give youan example of some of these agents. Agenetic AI is transforming every enterprise using sophisticatedreasoning and iterative planning to solve complex,multi-step problems. AI agents help marketing campaigns go live faster with instant insights,helping optimize supply chain operations, saving hundreds of millions in costs,and reduce software security processes from days to seconds by helping analyststriage vulnerabilities. What makes agenticAI so powerful is its ability to turn data into knowledge,and knowledge into action. A digital agent in this examplecan educate individuals with insights from a set of informationally denseresearch papers. It was built using NVIDIA AI Blueprints. These are reference workflowsfeaturing NVIDIA acceleration libraries, SDKs, and NIM microservices that help you rapidly buildand deploy AI apps. The multi-modal PDF Data ExtractionBlueprint helps build a data ingest pipeline,while the Digital Human Blueprint provides smooth, human-like interactions. “Hi, I’m James.� A digital agent ingests PDF researchpapers, including complex data like images, chartsand tables, and generates a high level summary delivered throughan interactive digital human interface. “What an exciting breakthrough in weatherforecasting. The development of CorrDiff,a new generative model, is a significant step forwardin accurately predicting weather patterns by combining a U-Net regression modelwith a diffusion model.� James can also answer questions or generate new contentbased on the papers. NVIDIA AI gives enterprisesthe power to automate processes, tap into real timeinsights, and enhance workflow efficiency. AI agents. Three parts: NeMo, NIMs, and Blueprints. These are all references. They're available to you in source formso that you could use it as you like and build your AI agent workforce. None of these agents can do 100% of anyone's task. Anybody's job. None of the agents can do 100%. However, all of the agents will be able to do work for 50% of your work. This is the great achievement. Instead of thinking about AI as replacingthe work of 50% of the people, you should think that AI will do50% of the work for 100% of the people. By thinking that way,you realize that AI will help boost your company'sproductivity, boost your productivity. You know, people have asked me,you know, is AI going to take your job? And I always say, because it's true, AI will not take your job. AI used by somebody else, will take your job. And so be sure to activateusing AI as soon as you can. So the first is digital AI agents. Digital. These are digital AIs. The second application is physical AI. The same basic technology is now embodied, sits inside a mechanical system. Of course, robotics is going to be one of the most importantindustries in the world. Until now, robotics has been limited and the reason is very, very clear. In fact, here in Japan, 50% of the world'smanufacturing robots are built. Kawasaki, FANUC, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi. Four of the leaders that buildhalf of the world's robotic systems. As much as robots have driven the productivity of manufacturing,it has been very difficult to expand. The robotics industryhas been largely flat for a long time. And the reason for thatis because it is too specific. It is not flexible enough. It is not flexible enoughto be able to apply to different scenarios and different conditionsand different work. We need AI that is much, much more flexible,that it can adapt and learn by itself. Notice the technology that we described upuntil now, agentic AI. Irrespective of who you are, you should beable to interact with the agents. It can give you response. Of course, sometimes the response is not as goodas the response that you would produce, but many of them are in facteven better than what we can produce. And so we can now apply this generalAI technology into the world of embodied AI or physical AI,or otherwise known as robotics. In order to enable robotics to happen,we need to build three computers. The first computer is training the AI, just like we did with all of the examplesI've given you so far. Second is to simulate the AI, you need to give theAI a place to practice, a place to learn, a place to retreat, to receive synthetic datathat it can learn from. We call that Omniverse. Omniverse is our virtual worlddigital twin suite of libraries that could be used for creating physical AIs, robotics. Omniverse, then, after validation,after training, after evaluation, then you can take the modeland put it into a physical robot. Inside that we have processorsthat are designed for robotics. We call it Jetson Thor. Thor is a robotics processordesigned for humanoid robots. This loop goes on and on and on. Just as there is a NeMo AI agent life cycle platform, there is this Omniverse platform that enables you to create AI. Well, ultimately, what you want is the AI—notice on the left—it sees a world, tt sees the video,it sees the surrounding, the circumstance. You tell it what you want. And this AI will generate articulation motion. Just as we take text,we can generate video, we can take textand generate chemicals for drugs. We can take text and generate articulation motion. So this concept is very similarto generative AI. And this is the reason why we think that now we have the necessary technologybetween Omniverse and all the computersthat we built, these three computers and the latest generative AI technology, that the time has come for humanoid robotics. Now, why is humanoid robotics so hard? Well, obviously the software developedfor humanoid robots is extremely hard. However, the benefit is incredible. There are only two robotic systems thatcan be easily deployed into the world. The first robot is a self-driving car,and the reason for that is because we created the worldto adapt to cars. The second is humanoid robots. These two robotic systemscould be deployed in brownfields anywhere in the world. Because we created the world for us. This is both extraordinarilyhard technology that the time has come,but the impact can be enormous. Well, this last week at the Conferencefor Robotics Learning, we announced a new frameworkthat is super important. It's called Isaac Lab. Isaac Lab is a reinforcementlearning virtual simulation system that allows you to teach humanoid robotshow to be humanoid robots. And on top of it, we have severalworkflows that we have created. The first workflow is Groot-Mimic. Groot-Mimic is a frameworkfor demonstrating to the robot how to perform a task. You use human demonstration and then mimic that environment, using domain randomization generates hundreds of other exampleslike your demonstration. So that the robot can learn to generalize. Otherwise it can only performthat very specific task. Using Mimic,we can generalize its learning. The second is Groot-Gen. Groot-Gen, using generativeAI technology in Omniverse, we can create an enormous number of random, domain randomized examples of environments and the actionsthat we would like the robot to perform. And so we're generating a whole bunchof tests, evaluation systems, evaluation scenariosthat the robot can try to perform and improve itself, learnhow to be a good robot. And the third is Groot-Control. Groot-Control is a model distillationframework that allows us to take all of the skills that we've learnedand distill it into one unified model that allows the robot to performkinematic skills. Not only will robots be autonomous, but remember thatthe future factories will also be robotic. And so these factoriesare going to be robotic factories that are orchestrating robots, buildingmechanical systems that are robotic. Let me show it to you. Physical AI embodies robots like self-driving carsthat safely navigate the real world, manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks, and humanoid robotswho work collaboratively alongside us. Plants and factories will be embodiedby physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operationsor speaking to us. NVIDIA builds three computers to enable developersto create physical AI. The models are first trained on DGX, then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcementlearning physics feedback in Omniverse. And the trained AI runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX robotics computers. NVIDIA Omniverse is a physics-basedoperating system for physical AI simulation. Robots learn and fine tune their skills in Isaac Lab,a robot gym built on Omniverse. And with GR00T workflows like GR00T-Gen to generate diverselearning environments and layouts, GR00T-Mimic to generate large scalesynthetic motion datasets based on a small number of real-world captures, and GR00T-Controlfor neural whole body control. This is just one robot. Future factories will orchestrate teamsof robots and monitor entire operationsthrough thousands of sensors. For factory digital twins, they use an Omniverseblueprint called Mega. With Mega, the factory digital twin is populatedwith virtual robots and their AI models—the robots' brains. The robots execute a task by perceivingtheir environment, reasoning, planning their next motion,and finally converting it to actions. These actions are simulated in the environmentby the World Simulator in Omniverse, and the results are perceived by the robot brainsthrough Omniverse sensor simulation. Based on the sensor simulations,the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and positionof everything in the factory digital twin. This software in the looptesting brings software defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments,letting industrial enterprises simulate and validate changesin an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world,saving massive risk and cost. The era of physical AI is here, transforming the world'sheavy industries and robotics. Incredible times. So we have two robotic systems. One that's digital. We call AI agents,and you use them in your office, collaborating with your employees. And then the second is a physical AI,physical AI system, robotics. And these physical AIs will be productsthat the company's built. And so companies will use AI to increasethe productivity of our employees. And we will use AI to drive and power the products that we sell. Car companies will have two factoriesin the future one factory to build cars, one factory to produce the AI that runs in the car. Well, this is the robotics revolution. So much activity is going around the worldand I can't imagine a better country to lead the roboticsAI revolution than Japan. And the reason for that is, as you know, this country loves robots. You love robots. You have created some of the world's best robots. These are the robots we grew up with. These arethe robots we've loved our whole lives. I didn't even show some of my favorites, Mazinger Z, Gundam. I hope that Japan will take advantageof the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and combinethat with your expertise in mechatronics. No country in the world has greater skills in mechatronics than Japan. This is an extraordinaryopportunity that you must seize. And so I hope that we can work togetherto make that dream possible. NVIDIA AI inJapan is doing incredibly well. We have so many partners here. We have partners that are building large languagemodels. Institute of Science Tokyo, Rakuten, SoftBank Intuitions, NTT, Fujitsu, NEC, Nagoya University, Kotoba Technologies. We also have if you go to the upper right,the AI clouds. AIST, SoftBank, Sakura Internet, GMO Internet Group, HIGHRESO, KDDI, Rutilea, building AI clouds herefor the ecosystem to flourish here in Japan. So many roboticscompanies are starting to understand the capabilities that AI is now providingto take advantage of the opportunity, Yaskawa, Toyota, Kawasaki, Rapyuta. Medical imaging systems— Canon, Fuji Films, Olympus—all taking advantage of AI because in the future, these medicalinstruments will be much more autonomous. It's almost like a nurseAI agent inside the medical instrument, helping the nurse guide the diagnosis. So many different ways, the drugdiscovery industry, so many different ways that AI is being used. And so I'm delighted. I'm delighted by the advancements here. And we want to go even fasterto take advantage of the revolution of AI. Well, this industry is changing. As I said earlier, the computer industryhas fundamentally changed. From coding that runs on CPU to now machine learning running on GPUs. From an industry that produced software, we have now become an industry that is manufacturingartificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligenceis produced in factories. They're running 24/7. When you license software, you install it onto your computer. The manufacturing, the distributionof that software is complete. However, intelligence is never complete. And you're interacting with all of the AIs, whether they're AI agents or AI robots. And the tokens, the intelligence is expressed in tokens,which is the unit of intelligence. It's a number. And these numbers are constituted. These tokens are constituted in waysthat becomes intelligence and words, intelligence in steering wheels,intelligence for self-driving cars, intelligence in motors to articulate human robots, intelligence in proteins and chemicalsand drug discovery. All of these tokens are being producedin these factories, these infrastructure,these factories never existed before. It's a brand new thing, which is the reason why we're seeingso much development around the world. For the very first time, we have a new industry, a new factory producing somethingbrand new, that we call artificial intelligence. These factorieswill be built by companies. They'll be built. Every company will be an AI manufacturer. Of course, no company can afford not to manufacture,produce, artificial intelligence. How can any company affordnot to produce intelligence? How can any country affordnot to produce intelligence? You don't have to produce chips. You don't have to produce software,but you have to produce intelligence. It is vital. It is core to who you are. It is core to who we are. And so we have the new industry, AI factories. And that's the reason why I call it. It's a new industrial revolution. The last time this happenedwas 300 years ago when electricity was discovered,the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricityand a new type of factory was created. And that new factory was a power plant. And then a new industrywas created called energy. Several hundred years ago, there was no such thingas an energy industry. It happenedduring the Industrial Revolution. Now we have a new industry,never existed before. Artificial intelligence sits on top of the computer industry,but it's utilized, it is created by every industry. You have to create your own AI. The drug industry—creates your own AI. The automotive industry—creates your own AI. The robotics industry—creates your own AI. Every industry, every company,every country must produce your own AI. A new industrial revolution. I have a very big announcement to make. Today we're announcing that we're partneringwith SoftBank to bring and to build an AI infrastructure for Japan. Together, we're going to buildJapan's largest AI factory. It's going to be built out of NVIDIA DGX. When it's built, it'll have 25 AI exaflops. Just remember, the largest supercomputer in the world just recently was 1 exaflop. This is 25 exaflops for an AI factory to produce the AI. But in order to distribute the AI,SoftBank is going to integrate NVIDIA's Aerial, which was the engine that I mentioned earlier,running the 5G radio on CUDA. By doing that, we can unify and combine the radio computers, the basebands and the AI computers from 5G-RAN. We can now evolve and reinventthe telecommunications network into AI-RAN. It will be able to carry voice,data, video, but in the future we will also carry AI, a new type, a new type of information: intelligence. This will be distributed across SoftBank's200,000 sites here in Japan, serve 55 million customers. AI factoryand to produce the AI, and AI distributionnetworks to distribute AI-RAN to distribute the AI. We're also going to put on top of it a new type of store, an AI store, so that the AIs that were createdby SoftBank and the AIs created by third parties could be providedto the 55 million customers. So we will build those applications on top of NVIDIA AI enterprise,as I mentioned, showed you before and there will be a new storethat makes AI available to everybody. This is just a magnificent development. What will result is an AI grid that runs across Japan. Now this AI grid will be part of infrastructureand one of the most important infrastructures. Remember, you need factories and roads,part of the infrastructure so that you could just make and distributegoods. You need energy and communications,it's part of the infrastructure. Every time you create somethingfundamentally new for the infrastructure, new industries and new companies are created, new economic opportunities, new prosperity. If not for roads and factories,how would we have the Industrial Revolution? If not for energy and communications, how would we have the IT revolution? Each one of these new infrastructuresopen up new opportunities, and so it's incredibly excitingfor me to partner with SoftBank to make this possible in Japan. Miyakawa-san's team, they should be in the audience. Partnering with you is incredible. And, really, really happythat we're doing this. This is completely revolutionary. This is the first of its kind to transform the telecommunications network,the communications network, into an AI network. Well, let me show you what you can do. There's some amazing things you could do. For example, I'm standing underneath one of the base stations, one of the radio towers, and the car has video, and the car’s video is streamed to the radio tower and the radio tower has AI. This radio tower has video intelligence. It has vision intelligence. So it could see what the car sees and it can understandwhat the car is seeing. That AI model may be too heavyto put inside the car, but it's not too heavy to put in the base station. And using the videothat's streamed to the base station, it can understand anything that'shappening to the car and surrounding. Okay, so this is just one example of using AI at the edge to keep people safe. Or maybe this is the air traffic control, essentially, for self-driving cars. The applications are endless. We can also use this basic concept to turn a whole factory into an AI. This is a factory on this side. Lots of cameras. The cameras are streamed to the base station. And what's amazing is this: because of all the cameras and the AI model in the AI-RAN, now this factory became an AI. You can talk to the factory. Ask the factory, what is happening? Ask the factory, were there any accidents? Is there anything abnormal happening? Was anybody injured today? Could it give you a daily report? You just have to ask the factory, becausethe factory now has turned into an AI. That AI model doesn'thave to run in the factory. That AI model can run in the SoftBank radio. Okay, so that's another example. But the countless examples,you can basically turn every single physical object into an AI, a stadium, a road, a factory,a warehouse, an office, a building. They can all become AIs and you can justtalk to it, just like you can talk to ChatGPT. Okay. What's the condition of the aisles? Any obstruction or spills? You're just talking to the factory. And the factory has observed everything. It understands what it sees. It can reason and it can plan an action or just talk to you. And here it says \"No, the aisles in the warehouse did not have any obstruction, spills or hazards. The conditions of the aisles in the video appears to be well-organized, clean, and free of obstacles or hazards.\" Okay, so you're talking to the factory. It's incredible. You're talking to the warehouse. You're talking to the car. Because all of thesehave now become intelligent. Well, I have a very special guestto talk about our announcement today and also to talk aboutbringing AI to Japan. And this friend of mine,this friend of mine. You might know him. That's the two of us. You might know him. This friend of mine is really,genuinely unique. Where is Masa? Where is Son-san? Is he here? He’s here. Hey! Son-san. Ladies and gentlemen. The great Masa. Great Jensen. Let me let me tell you something. I don't know if you know this. So we've been in, I've been in thetechnology industry a long time. Started in the PC revolution. The computer industry went from PC to Internet, to cloud, to mobile cloud, to AI. Long journey. Masa is the only entrepreneuronly entrepreneur, only innovator in the world that has selected the winner and partnered with the winner, in every single generation. Remember, it was Masa thatbrought Bill Gates to Japan. It was Masa that invented or brought,Jerry Yang to Japan. It was Masa that made it possible for China'scloud industry to happen— Alibaba. It was Masa that brought Steve Jobsto Japan and the iPhone. And maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point Masa was the largest shareholder of NVIDIA. Yes. Oh. It’s okay. We can we can cry. We can cry together. Yeah. Sit down. Sit. How did you do it? How did you pick the innovators, the creators of each one of the technology revolutionsin the history of computing? 100% record. Well, I think I was just lucky. I was born in the right time, and I met with great entrepreneurslike yourself, right? It's a passion. It's a dream. And it's an instinct that you smell, is the real pioneer who is a real, you know, innovator. And, I really think I was lucky, but it's the same visionthat we can smell, right? It's like, wolf smell wolf. I think we smell each other. I have two puppies. I don't like that mental image. No. No. Masa, each, as you think back on the history. Yes.- How is this transition, this platform shift,this revolution, how is this one differentthan the previous ones? How does it feel different to you? Well, I say this is the most exciting,most dynamic, front end of the future. This is 100 times, a thousand times bigger. This is the biggest wave. I thought that's how it feels. Yeah, yeah. I think mathematicallyor from an industrial perspective, the important thing to realizeis that although AI is software,it is a very different type of software. Yeah. The software industry you and I created, and are part of is an industry of tools. It's tools used by humans. Yeah. For the very first time,this new type of software, neural network, Large Language Models, agents, robots are not tools, but they are skills. They're tasks. They do work. - Yeah. They can perform work. And the industry, the market,the industry of work is not $1 trillion, it is $100 trillion. And that's the reason why we realized that this industry is, in fact, not a transition of the IT industry. But this is a transition of every industry.- Yes. Which is the reason why it’s such a big deal. Yeah. Mankind is the only animal that has the super braincompared to any other species. Because of brain power, mankind is so powerful. If you compare just the muscles, lions and the elephants,they have a bigger muscle. But mankind has the smartest brain. And every activity of GDPs today is based onmankind's type of brain activity. So I think every industry will be affected by this revolution. And one of the one of the amazing things,of course, is that, in the industry that is governed by atoms, the size of the industry is limited. Because there's only so much atomsyou can move around. It's heavy. - That's right. But the industry of AIis industry of electrons. Exactly. It's governed by quantum mechanics. Right, right, right. It can be infinitely large. Yeah. And intelligence. Intelligence is so much more valuable compared to just moving things. You know, you think, chain of thought, reasoning. It's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah, Masa one of the things that we announced todaytogether is building the AI grid of Japan. Yeah, yeah. And the AI grid will have AI factoriesfor developing the AI models. It will have AI-RAN distribute the AI models all over Japan. The architecture of theAI factory in the AI-RAN that we worked on togetheris revolutionary. Yeah. The world has nothing like this. Japan will be the world's first. Yeah, every other telco will have to follow thisnew wave. Yeah. And. And so several things thatthat I want to ask you. So one, how would SoftBank use this yourselffor SoftBank and your subsidiaries? And how do you imagine this AI gridwill revolutionize AI here in Japan? Yeah, as you just mentioned our cell towersused to just carry bits for the telecommunication and internetsurfing and so on. However, now with this intelligence network that we densely connect each other, becomes one big neural brain, right? For the infrastructureof intelligence for Japan. That will be amazing. - Yeah. You know, and of course, you could use itfor your subsidiaries like LINE, Yahoo Japan. And PayPay. That's right.- Yeah. And so it will create AIs to make all of your servicesmore enjoyable and more useful to your consumers. But one of the things that I'm very excited about ismaking this resource available so that, so that, researchers and students,startup companies can flourish here in Japan. Yes, definitely. And with your support, we are creating the largest AI data center here in Japan, which, I'm talking with Miyakawa that we should providethis platform to many of those researchers, the students, the startups, so that we, we can encourage with, we are trying to subsidize so thatthey have a better access, much more compute. Yeah. Well, building infrastructureis very capital intensive. And you're making a very big bet on Japan. - Yes. You know that you and I have spokenabout this before. In a lot of ways, Japan technology leddoing the mechatronics era. Yes.- During that industrial revolution when when mechanical technologyelectronics came together. In fact, even consumer electronics, during that age, Japanreally led the world, right? And then when, when theIT industry came and software came, there was a, there was a missthat I think the last three decades, as the software industries flourishedin the West and in China, really, Japan could have beenmore aggressive. Totally agree. Totally. Yeah. And back in those days,even to some extent today, big enterprise, the medias, the big grown up guys, they used to say, 'monozukuri'—meaning, ‘making physical stuff.’ Physical stuff has the real value and the real meaning. And software is something virtualthat they don't trust, the value of software. That has been the mentality for many, many years in Japan that led young, startup guys, the young,you know, generations discouraged, especially after the net bubble crash. Everybody criticized. I was criticized a lot. And that really, you know, was sort oflike a punishment to the young stars. Made, you know, the, depressed feeling. I think we have to revive this passionwhich the robotics is bringing with AI. As you say, you know,bring AI intelligence into robotics. Astro Boy, in Japan, we call ‘Tetsuwan Atomu.’My favorite cartoon. You cannot just have the muscle. It has to have, intelligenceso that the robot can talk. Robot can have a passion,as a friend, you know. I think that kind of, front end challengeis, is very, very needed here. Yeah. Yeah, I think the software era was, is now, The good news is thatthis is the beginning of a new era. Yeah. Reset. Once more, reset. Reset button. That’s right. The industry is in reset. And you could see that the entire stackis being reset because the companies of the last generation arenot doing so well in this new generation. That's right. And so there's an emergence of a wholenew stack, a whole new opportunity. Right. Japan must take advantage.Must take advantage of this time. And artificial intelligence is verydifferent than software. Artificial intelligence requiresthat you have data, that you have domain expertise. Yes. If you are an artist,you have domain expertise, if you develop video games,you have domain expertise. If you look for drugs, you discover drugs,you have domain expertise. If you have domain expertise,you can describe your expertise in data. That data could be used to trainan AI model. That AI model becomesyour artificial intelligence. That's right. At least, Japanese government is not trying to, you know, depress the, this AI revolution. Some of the other countries, they try to be overprotective of the, intelligence, artificial intelligence, so the regulation goes a little crazy. Here in Japan, at least we are lucky that this time Japanese government seems not, you know, trying to,depress, at least no handicap. So I think, but they should encourage more. They should encourage more. As you said, this is the reset. This is the catch up momentfor this new revolution. We can't miss this time. Cannot miss this time. And of course, in order to be partof the AI revolution, you need, this time, you need infrastructure.- Right. This type of software,because it's machine learning. We’re gonna buy a lot of your chips. Well, thank you, thank you. - Yes. And and, you need infrastructure. You need AI factories. Without the infrastructure,it's not possible to create AI. Totally. That's the reason why SoftBank is buildingthe AI grid in Japan. And you will catalyze, you will activate,you’ll turbocharge all of the activity that's here already. We're going to show by our example. Yeah. And hopefully, todaywe have 350 startups in Japan. 350 startups that we work with out of 22,000 in the world. Yeah. It makes no sense. That's right. And so we we must encourage,the young entrepreneurs, the innovators. Yeah, yeah. To jump, to leap, to engage AI. The infrastructure is coming. Yeah. So as I said, Miyakawa and I are discussing, we're going to create the largestAI data center here in Japan. So we are going to provide a lot of encouraging program. Subsidize the compute power, so that they can they can use almost free. Okay, almost free to try out the new models, try out the, you know, whatever, the applications of AI. You should also help with some donation, right? Okay. Hey, Jensen! For some sort of startup, and researchers— This is the last time I'm inviting myself to—Every time I see Masa, it costs me money. Yeah. That's good for everybody. Yes, yes. Yeah. Very happy about that. Masa, what are you most excited aboutfor the future of AI in Japan? What do you hope? What is your dream? Well, look, you know, as you say,I am passionate about, AI robotics. I think the medical solutions, I think medical agents is definitely coming. I think a lot of, new agents. You know, so we have LINE, we have Yahoo and other services, Paypay. We can make many specific AI agents for, for helping Japanese lifestyle. That cannot just come from US, you know,we know about Japanese behaviors, the cutures, the local intelligence and APIs to many, many, sites in Japan. So that I think, agents, I think every—you mentioned about, enterprise AI agents, definitely I support that. I'm excited about that. But also, I think personal agents willreally come to every one of us. Bill gates said, the PC on every desktop. Steve said, a smartphone in every hand. I think now we should say, AI agents to everybody. So each of usshould have our own personal agents. That's right. That will help make our plans for trips,vacations. Right? Education. And it follows you your whole life. Yeah. Yeah. Could you imagine an AI agentthat knows you your whole life? Exactly. Our grandkids, they grow up with, iPhones from, you know, age one, right? They talk, and every timethey see some picture, they do this even with a still picture. Right? Because they are born the,you know, with two fingers, they can they think, you know,every picture can be, blown up. In the future, they'll see a picture,they'll talk to it. Right. They talk. They'll hope it talks back.You can ask it questions. They will have agent, their personal agentssince the age of one and their personal agent, like your,you know, second buddy to see you grow together with you knows everything. You are sick. You know, your health. Your tutor. Yeah. Yeah. Since you were a child. Exactly. Yeah. Remember everything that you read? Remember everything that it taught you,right? That. Yeah. Your personal Aristotle. Totally, totally digital twin. You know? I think that is really coming and having, you know, Japanese domestic knowledge, culture and so on, homegrown agents will have a huge, amazing future. You know, one of the thingsMasa, that countries are awakening to is that the data of their country, their, their citizens' data, encodes the country's knowledge, its culture, its intelligence. And that data belongs to the countrylike its national resources. National security, national security. So that country, every country,should process that data, process and turn it into itsAI for its own people. Totally, totally. Makes no sense to outsourcethat to somebody else. Oh, this is this is very, very important.It's a sovereign data center. Their each sovereign, each country, each governmenthave to migrate, their national security data into their own data center,AI data center. That becomes the, something that you have to havein your own country. Each country have to havenational security, data security. I think that will become, regulated to each protection of each country. Yeah. Every country, every countrywill produce its own intelligence. Of course, every companywill produce their own intelligence. Their own AI. How is it possible that a company, does not create its own AI? Yeah. A company doesn't— It’s like giving your brain away to somebody else. That's right, that's right. And so I think, I think,the world is awakening to this idea. And the most important part is the first part, is that a national grid, an AI grid, has to exist. Right. You cannot have an automotive industryif there are no roads. Totally, totally. You know, and so so now you havebuilt the AI roads for Japan. On top of it, you know, all kinds of new services,new companies can flourish. Totally. So really, really excited about that. Well, Masa-san. Could you imagine if today, you were the largest shareholder. Oh my God. [laughs] Yeah. We tried this. We tried, we tried to. It was three times. Was it three times?I thought it was two times. No, no. The first time, we became yourshareholder by ourselves buying from the market. We talked about the, you know, the... We even talked about. Some things we can share.- Right? You and I had a private talk. I don't want, don't say it. You know, ten years ago—- Oh, I know. I have regretted it. —in my garden. All right. There's nothing. Okay, let me tell you what Masa said. Are you guys ready? So Masa said, “Jensen, the market does notunderstand the value of NVIDIA. Your future is incredible. But the marketdoesn't understand it.� That was ten years ago. “And your journey of suffering will continue for some time.Because you are inventing this future.� “ So, let me give you the money to buy NVIDIA.� He wanted to lend me money to buy NVIDIA. All of it. Now I regret not taking you up on it. That was a great idea. Oh, that was a great idea right? Now, now we're both sad. That was one month after I acquired Arm. Yes, yes. And then we talked aboutcombining the two companies. That was another. Another.That was a good dream too. That was the third one.That was the third attempt. Yeah, right. The first we talked about this privatizing and then second was weI just bought from the market. And then the third time was merging. Three attempts! Oh my god. Well now we are going to we're going to createincredible value together. So NVIDIA and SoftBankare going to partner together. Yeah. The market is so huge! It's incredible. So huge, so huge. And so I am so happy. I'm so happy that that we're doingsomething of this great significance. Yeah. Here in Japan, I, I am very hopeful. Well, this is just the beginning. We're going to do many,many things together. Thank you. And the industry is so big and, you know,Arm has lots of mobile and IoTs and autos. And you have a great datacenters and games and so forth. Many, many things that we can collaborate. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah.Masa-san! Ladies and gentlemen, Son-san. Yeah. Unquestionably one of the great entrepreneursthe world ever seen. No, no. You are the greatest. - Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you. Masa-san. You could seeyou could see his passion for AI. The work, the partnership that we'redeveloping is going to bring an AI grid throughout Japan from the factoryto the distributed AI-RANs. Before I before I leave, I wantto welcome all of you to AI Summit. We have so many sessions here,so many partners here. Our purpose. Our purpose is to partner with you, to bring AI, to activate AI here in Japan, and to use this reset, this opportunity,where technology has reset for us to transform the companies and to create the nextgreat companies here in Japan. Japan has always been dear to me. Most of you do not know that if not for Japan and I mean this very seriously, if not for Japan,NVIDIA would not be here today. And there's a reason for that. If not for Japan,we would have not seen the first AI supercomputer, CUDA supercomputer built. So Japan has been very dear to mefor a very long time. I'm very grateful for our partnership. I'm very grateful for your friendship. And I made a small videoto share with you. Please run it. “If there is a heart in the fish, there is a heart in the water.� Our friendship with Japan began 30 years ago. “Ready? Go!� We had a dream to reinvent 3D graphics. SEGA, with its groundbreaking 3D games, chose NVIDIA to build its next game console. But it became clear our unconventional approach would not live up to our vision. With humility, we asked SEGA’s Irimajiri-San to release us from our obligations. He generously agreed, giving us the time needed to invent the GPU, a chance for success — saving our company. In the years since, we've worked with Japan to redefine gaming on the PlayStation 3, SEGA Arcades, and the Nintendo Switch. And created a medium for telling beautiful stories. With the invention of CUDA, we transitioned from a gaming company to a computing company. As we expanded into the world of Supercomputing and AI, it was Japan's then Tokyo Tech that first saw the promise of GPU accelerated computing. “It’s just the beginning of GPU acceleration becoming mainstream.� Less than a decade after Tsubame, we introduced DGX-1. The AI computer that changed the world. “A GPU is not just a GPU anymore.� NVIDIA and AI are now at the center of a new industrial revolution. From the beginning, Japan has been a friend on the NVIDIA journey. And our story together is just getting started. Thank you, Japan. Have a great AI Summit. Thank you. please welcome Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Applause] Hong hello [Applause] mumai wow it's so great to be here Mumbai so much happening this is as you know India very very dear to the world's computer industry Central to the IT industry at the center at the core of the it of just about every single company in the world my industry your industry that we've built over the last several decades is going through fundamental change seismic change tectonic shifts let's talk about that today but before we start let me thank all of our partners our incredible partners that we're working with here in India to transform the IT industry together and so I'm delighted that all of you have joined us today there are two fundamental shifts that are happening at the same time this hasn't happened since 1964 the year after my birth it wasn't because of my birth but in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced the world to the concept of it the IT industry as we know it introduced the idea of general purpose Computing they described a central processing unit a CPU IO subsystems multitasking the separation of hardware and application software through a layer called the operating system IBM described family compatibility for application so that you could benefit by the install base of your Hardware to run your software over a long period of time they described architectural benefit across Generations so that the investment that you make in software the Investments you make in using the software is not squandered every single time you buy new hardware they recognized in 1964 the importance of in based the importance of software investment the importance of building computers that run the software architecture discipline all described in 1964 I've just described today's computer industry the same industry that the India IT industry was built from general purpose Computing as we know it has existed for 60 years until now for the last 30 years we've had the benefit of mors law an incredible phenomenon without changing the software the hardware can continue to improve in an architecturally compatible way and the benefits of that software doubles every year as a result of doubling in performance every year depending on what your applications you're reducing your cost by a factor of two every single year the most incredible depreciating force of any technology the world's ever known by depreciation cost reduction it made it possible for society to use more and more of it as we continue to consume it as we continue to process more data mors law made it possible for us to continue to drive down cost the critizing Computing as we know it today those two events the invention of the system 360 More's law with Windows PC drove what unquestionably one of the most important industries in the world every single industry has subsequently been built on top of it it but we know now that the scaling of CPUs has reached its limit we can't continue to ride that curve that that free Free Ride The Free Ride of Moors law has ended we have to now do something different or depreciation will end and we now will not enjoy depreciation but experience inflation Computing inflation and that's exactly what's happening around the world we no longer can afford to do nothing in software and expect that our computing experience will continue to improve that cost will decrease and continue to spread the benefits of it and to benefit from solving greater and greater challenges we started our company to accelerate software our vision was there are applications that would benefit from acceleration if we augmented general purpose Computing we take the workload that is very computer intensive and we offload it and we accelerate it using a model we call Cuda a programming model that we invented called cuda that made it possible for us to accelerate applications tremendously that acceleration benefit has the same qualities as mores law for applications that were impossible or impractical to perform using general purpose Computing we have the benefits of accelerated Computing to realize that capability for example computer Graphics real-time computer Graphics was made possible because of Nvidia coming into the world and make possible this new processor we call gpus the GPU was really the first accelerated Computing architecture running Cuda running computer Graphics a perfect example we democratized computer Graphics as we know it 3D Graphics is now literally everywhere it could be used as a medium for almost any application but we felt that longterm accelerated Computing could be far far more impactful and so over the last 30 years we've been on a journey to accelerate one domain of application after another the reason why this has taken so long is simply because of this there is no such magical processor that can accelerate everything in the world because if you could do that you would just call it a CPU you need to reinvent the Computing stack from the algorithms to the architecture underneath and connected to applications on top in one domain after another domain computer Graphics is a beginning but we've taken this architecture Cuda architecture from one industry after another industry after another industry today we accelerate so many important industries ktho is fundamental to semiconductor manufacturing computational lithography simulation computer Aid and Engineering even 5G radios that we've recently announced part Partnerships with that we can accelerate the 5G software stack Quantum Computing so that we can invent the future of computing with classical Quantum hybrid Computing parabricks are Gene sequencing software stack CVS one of the most important things every single company's working on is going from databases to knowledge bases so that we can create AI databases using qvs that we can create and vectorize all of your data qdf data frames data frames is essentially another word for structured data SQL acceleration is possible with qdf in each one of these different libraries we're able to accelerate the application 20 30 50 times of course it takes a rewrite of software which is the reason why it's taken so long in each one of these domains we've had to work with the industry work with our ecosystem software developers and customers in order to accelerate those applications for their domains kopt one of my favorites combinatorial Computing application a very uh Compu intensive application for example the travel salesperson problem every supply chain every driver Rider combination those applications could be accelerated with Coop incredible speed up modulus teaching and AI the laws of physics not just to be able to predict next word but to be able to predict the next moment in time of fluid dynamics and particle physics and so on so forth and of course one of the most famous application libraries we've ever created called cdnn made it possible to democratize artificial intelligence as we know it these acceleration libraries Now cover so many different domains that it appears that accelerated Computing is used everywhere but that's simply because we've applied this architecture one domain after another domain that we've covered just about every single industry now accelerated Computing or Cuda has reached the Tipping Point several years ago about a decade ago something very important happened and most of you have seen the same thing alexnet made a gigantic leap in the performance of computer vision computer vision is a very important field of artificial intelligence Alex net surprised the world with how much of a leap that it was able to produce we had the benefit of taking a step back and asking ourselves what are we witnessing why is alexnet so effective how far can it scale what else can we do with this approach called Deep learning and if we were to find ways to apply deep learning to other problems how does it affect the computer industry and if we wanted to do that if we believe in that future and we're excited about what deep learning can do how would we change every single layer of the Computing stack so that we could reinvent Computing all together 12 years ago we decided to dedicate our entire company to go pursue this Vision it is now 12 years later you every single time I've come to India I've had the benefit of talking to you about deep learning had benefit of talking to you about machine learning and I think it's very very clear now the world has completely changed now let's think about what happened the first thing that happened of course is how we do software our industry is underpinned by the method by which software is done the way that software was done call It software 1.0 program rers would code algorithms we call functions into to run on a computer and we would apply it to input information to predict an output somebody would write python or C or Fortran or Pascal or C++ code algorithms that run on a computer you apply input to it and output is produced very classically the computer model that we understood quite well and it of course created one of the largest Industries in the world right here in India the production of software coding programming became a whole industry this all happened within our generation however that approach of developing software has been disrupted it is now not coding but machine learning using a computer using a computer to study the patterns and relationships of massive amounts of observed data to essentially learn from it the function that predicts it and so we are essentially designing a universal function approximator using machines to learn the expected output that would produce such a function and so going back and forth looking this is software 1.0 with human coding to now software 2.0 using machine learning notice who is writing the software the software is now written by the computer and after you're done training the model you inference the model you then apply that function now as the input that function that large language model that deep learning model that computer vision model speech understanding model is now an input neural network that goes into the GPU that can now make a prediction given new input unobserved input this way of doing software notice is based on fundamentally machine learning and we have gone from coding to machine learning from developing software to creating artificial intelligence and from soft that prefers to run on CPUs to now neural networks that runs best on gpus this at its core is what happened to our industry in the last 10 years we have now seen the complete reinvention of the Computing stack the whole technology stack has been reinvented the hardware the way that software is able is is developed and what software can do is now fundamentally different we dedicated ourselves to advance this field and so this is what we now build what all of you have initially when I first met India we were building gpus that fit into a PCI Express card that goes into your PC this is what a GPU looks like today this is Blackwell incredible system that is designed to study data at an enormous scale yeah thank you a massive system designed to study data at an enormous scale so that we could discover patterns and relationships and learn the meaning of the data this is the Greek breakthrough in the last several years we have now learn the representation or the meaning of words and numbers and images and pixels and videos chemicals proteins amino acids fluid patterns particle physics we have now learned the meaning of so many different types of data we have learned to represent how to represent information in so many different modalities not only have we learned the meaning of it we can translate it to another modality so one great example of course is translating English to Hindi translating English large body of text into other English summarization from pixels to image image recognition from words to pixels image generation from images videos to words captioning from words to proteins used for drug discovery from words to chemicals discovering new compounds from amino acids to proteins understanding the structure of proteins these fundamental ideas essentially a universal translator of information from any modality to another modality has led to a Cambrian explosion of the number of startups in the world they're applying the basic method I just described if I could this and that what else can I do if I can do that and this what else can I do the number of applications has clearly exploded in the last couple two three years the number of generative AI companies around the world tens of thousands tens of billions of dollars have been invested in this field all because of this one instrument that made it possible for us to study data at enormous scales well I just want to say that that in order to build the black wall system of course the Blackwell GPU is involved but it takes seven other chips tsmc manufacture all of these chips and they're just doing an extraordinary job ramping the Blackwell system this is in a all in Blackwell is in full production and we're hoping to uh we're expecting to deliver in volume production in Q4 and so this is basically Blackwell now this is one of the things that's really incredible about about the system let me show it to you nothing's easy this morning this is MV link and it goes across the entire back spine of a rack of gpus and these gpus are all connected from the top to the bottom using MV link driving these incredible cies the world's longest driving CES for copper and it connects uh all of these gpus together 72 dual GPU packages of black WS 144 gpus connected together so it's one giant GPU if I were to spread out all of the chips to show you what this connects together it's essentially a GPU so large it' be like this big but it's obviously impossible to build gpus that large so we break it up into the L the smallest chunks we could which is retical limits and the most Advanced Technologies and we connect it together using MV link this is mvlink backs spine you're looking at all of the gpus being connected that's the quantum switch that connects all of these gpus together on top Spectrum X if you would like to have ethernet and uh what connects this together this is like 50 lbs this I'm just demonstrating how strong I am this is connected to this switch and this is one of the most advanced switches the world's ever built now all of this together represents Blackwell and then it runs the software uh that's on top the Cuda software CNN software uh Megatron for training the large language models tensor RT for doing the inference tensor RT llm for doing uh distributed multi-gpu inference for large language models and then on top of that we have two software Stacks one is NVIDIA AI Enterprise that I'll talk about in a second and then the other is Omniverse I'll talk about both of those in a second this job is surprisingly rigorous so this is the Blackwell system this is what Nvidia builds today those of you who have known us for very long time it's really quite surprising how the company has transformed but literally we reason from first principles how Computing was going to be done in the future and this is Blackwell now the Blackwell system the Blackwell system is extraordinary of course the computation is incredible each rack is 3,000 lb 120 kilowatt Watts 120,000 watts in each rack the density of computing the highest the world's ever known and what we're trying to do is to learn larger and smarter models it's called the scaling law the scaling law comes from the fact that the observation that the empirical observation and measurements that suggests the more data you have to train a large language model with and therefore to correspondingly large model size you know the more information you want to learn from the larger the model has to be or the larger model you would like to train the more data you need to have and each one each year we're increasing the amount of data and the model size each by about a factor of two which means that every single year the computation which is the product of those two has to increase by a factor of four now remember there was a time when the world Mo's law was two times every year and a half or 10 times every 5 years 100 times every 10 years we are now moving technology at a rate of four times every year four times every year over the course of 10 years incredible scaling and we continue to find that AI continues to get smarter as we scale up the uh uh the training size the second thing that we've discovered recently and this is a very big deal after you're done training the model of course uh all of you have used chat GPT when you use chat GPT is a oneshot you ask you give it a prompt instead of writing a program to Compu communicate with a computer today you write a prompt you just talk to the talk to the computer the way you talk to a person you describe the context you describe what it is you're you're querying about uh you could ask it to write a program for you you could you know ask it uh to write a recipe for you whatever question would like to have and the AI process through a very large neural network and produces a sequence of answers producing one one uh one word after another word in the future and starting with strawberry we realize that of course intelligence is not just one shot but intelligence requires thinking and thinking is reasoning and maybe you're doing path planning and maybe you're doing some simulations in your mind you're reflecting on your own answers and so as a result thinking results in higher quality answers and we've now discovered a second scaling law and this is a SCA scaling law at a time of inference the longer you think the higher quality answer you can produce this is not illogical this is very very intuitive to all of us if you were to ask me what's my favorite Indian food I would tell you chicken briani okay and I don't have to think about that very much and I don't have to reason about that I just know it and there are many things that you can ask it like for example what's Nvidia good at Nvidia is good at building AI supercomputers nvidia's uh great at building gpus and those are things that you know that it's encoded into your knowledge however there are many things that requires reasoning you know for example if I had to travel from uh Mumbai to California I I want to do it in the in a way that allows me to enjoy four other cities along the way you know today uh I got here at 3:00 a.m. this morning uh I got here through Denmark I I and right before Denmark I was in Orlando Florida and before Orlando Florida I was in California that was two days ago and I'm still trying to figure out what day we're in right now but anyways I'm happy to be here uh if I were to to tell it I would like to go from California uh to Mumbai uh I would like to do it within uh 3 days uh and I give it all kinds of constraints about what time I'm willing to leave and able to leave what hotels I like to stay at so on so forth uh the people I have to meet the number of permutations of that of course uh quite high and so the planning of that process coming up with a optimal plan is very very complicated and so that's where thinking reasoning planning comes in and the more you compute the higher quality answer uh you could provide and so we now have two fundamental scaling laws that is driving our technology development first for training and now for inference the number of foundation model makers has more than doubled since the beginning of Hopper there are more companies that realize that fundamental intelligence is vital to their company and that they have to build Foundation model technology and second the size of the models have increased by 20 30 40x the amount of computation necessary to train these model because of uh the size of the models but also multimodality capability um reinforcement learning capability synthetic data generation capability the amount of data that we use to train these models has really grown tremendously that's one and then the other reason of course is that Blackwell is also used for generating tokens at incredible speeds and so together all of these factors has led to the demand for Blackwell being incredibly High let's talk about now how we're going to use this technology the headline I thought was really good Nvidia is AI in India now aside from the letter V you could use Nvidia to create the rest of that sentence which I thought was really cool you don't know this story but in 1993 we had to come up with a name for our company and the reason why we chose Nvidia I'll do the extreme short version the reason why I chose Nvidia in the end was because I really love Nvidia being sounds like a mystical Place India Nvidia and sounded like a great place and so if it turns out that computer graphics and accelerated Computing didn't work out for us we could do almost anything and so I'm just happy it worked out okay so so Nvidia in India uh we have we have a really rich ecosystem here uh the first thing that you have to realize is that in order to build an AI ecosystem in any industry or in any country you have to start first with the ecosystem of the infrastructure and we announced that Yoda that ET T Communications and our other partners uh are joining us to build fundamental Computing infrastructure here in India and in just one year's time by the end of this year we will have nearly 20 times more compute here in India than just a little over a year ago that's the amount of infrastructure we're y so the first part of building an AI ecosystem is the AI infrastructure just as the first part of uh infrastructure for the internet ecosystem was building the infrastructure of of networking of course uh the infrastructure of networking internet consists of the personal computer cloud and and internet itself um in the case of AI it starts with the AI Computing infrastructure the next part the operating system of AI is large language models and we've worked with Partners here in India to build the Hindi large language model and Hindi large language model as you know there's 25 different um uh formal languages here in in India with apparently um a new a dialect every you know 1,500 kilometers and so so you don't have to go very far before you need to train another model this is the hardest language model region in the world and if anybody could do it you can do it and and once India figures out how to create the Hindi large language model you could you could figure it out for every other country so the next layer is um the application layer above that and uh uh working with us to bring uh AI to uh the ecosystem of India of course uh AI native companies that are creating new applications that are started that made possible only with AI and then our Service Partners uh from from wiipro to infosis to to TCS working with us to take the AI models and the AI infrastructure out to the world's Enterprises now that's Nvidia in India I'm going to have uh Vel our country leader come join me on stage because I would love for him to talk to you about some of the companies that we're working with here in India velle V to par okay so I'm going to intr a couple of other ideas and so earlier I told you that we have Blackwell we have all of the libraries acceleration libraries that we were talking about before but on top there are two very important platforms we working on one of them is called Nvidia AI Enterprise and the other is called Nvidia Omniverse and I'll explain each one of them very Qui quickly first Nvidia AI Enterprise this is a time now where the large language models and the fundamental AI capabilities have reached a level of capabilities were able to now create what is called agents large language models that understand understand the data that of course it's being presented it could be it could be streaming data could video data language model data it could be data of all kinds the first stage is perception the second is reasoning about given its observations uh what is the mission and what is the task it has to perform in order to perform that task the agent would break down the that task into steps of other tasks and uh it would reason about what it would take and it would connect with other AI models some of them are uh good at produ for example understanding PDF maybe it's a model that understands how to generate images maybe it's a model that uh uh is able to retrieve information AI information AI semantic data from a uh proprietary database so each one of these uh large language models models are connected to the central reasoning large language model we call agent and so these agents are able to perform all kinds of tasks uh some of them are maybe uh marketing agents some of them are customer service agents some of them are chip design agents Nvidia has Chip design agents all over our company helping us design chips maybe they're software engineering uh agents uh maybe uh uh maybe they're able to do marketing campaigns uh Supply Chain management and so we're going to have agents that are helping our employees become super employees these agents or agentic AI models uh augment all of our employees to supercharge them make them more productive now when you think about these agents it's really the way you would bring these agents into your company is not unlike the way you would onboard uh someone uh who's a new employee you have to give them training curriculum you have to uh fine-tune them teach them how to use uh how to perform the skills and understand the vocabulary of your of your company uh you evaluate them and so they evaluation systems and you might guardrail them if you're accounting agent uh don't do marketing if you're a marketing agent you know don't report earnings at the end of the quarter so on so forth and so each one of these agents are guardrail um that entire process we put into essentially an agent life cycle Suite of library and we call that Nemo our partners are working with us to integrate these libraries into their platforms so that they could enable agents to be created onboarded deployed improved into a life cycle of agents and so this is what we call Nvidia Nemo we have um on the one hand the libraries on the other hand what comes out of the output of it is a API inference microser service we call Nims essentially this is a factory that builds AIS and Nemo is a suite of libraries that on board and help you operate the AIS and ultimately your goal is to create a whole bunch of Agents we have Partners here that we're working with in India and Vel if you could tell everybody about our ecosystem here absolutely Jensen you know the word that stuck me as I was standing behind was was a word called Mystique this is the Mystique of India Jensen was here exactly 12 months back and he asked me a pretty profound question that the rich tapestry of India how are you going to encode it and it All Began from the infrastructure as mentioned in just 12 months today we have Computing from Yota which has built the stateof thee art y infrastructure tatas are going live E2 e2e has been in existence giving us exceled Computing infrastructure for a long long period of time all this Computing helped us to leave frog to solve one of India's largest problem that is about communication like Jensen said we speak in so many languages he did say 1500 kilm but all of you know every 5050 kilomet we change our dialect we don't only speak English we speak English and if you are from South there'll be a little bit of malali also added into it so how do we make this really work is the work of some of our partners Serum is a classical example serum basically started their efforts to basically help India talk they decided we're going to do voice to voice and and while doing voice to voice they had to understand how does this language work which is multimodal how do we make sure that it performs and they came into existence pretty quickly because there was infrastructure that was available to us similarly we saw projects coming from bhat GPT again a work that has been done predominantly in Academia the Academia in India has been rich with ideas and every time they wanted an idea to be translated into reality they need infrastructure today the work that we are doing in iits the work that we are doing at different organization is all a result of coming together solving the critical issue that India Has Not only was the language getting solved we also realized very quickly that there are many mega challenges that India has no one loves India more than Michelle a well spoken Indian and a healthy Indian always make a difference and that's why we have companies who've been working on health as many of us know it's been challenging how do we look after our health but Diagnostics coming from s Tuple cure. is really helping us solve many of these challenges so with that promise Jensen that's awesome healthy yeah and well spoken healthy and well spoken and the the important thing here that the uh it takes an entire ecosystem of Partners to be able to help the world apply AI to help their employees be more productive and this is whereas India was focused on it the back office operations of software the delivery of software producing software the next generation of it is going to be about producing and delivery of AI and as you know the delivery of software coding and the delivery of AI is fundamentally different but dramatically more impactful insanely more exciting and the ability for this industry for India to help every single company around the world to enjoy the benefit of Agents to enjoy the benefits of AIS across all of their different functionalities to be able to deploy it at scale I don't know anybody else who could do it this is just an extraordinary opportunity our job is to help you build Ai and deploy AI your job is to take these libraries and the capabilities that we have combine it with your incredible it capability software capabilities so that we can create agents and help every single company benefit from it and so this is the first part the second part is this what happens after agents now remember every single company has employees but most companies the goal is to build something to produce something to make something and that those things that people make could be factories it could be warehouses it could be cars and planes and trains and uh ship ships and so on and so forth all kinds of things computers and servers the servers that Nvidia builds it could be phones most companies in the largest of Industries ultimately produces something sometimes produce production of service which is the IT industry but many of your customers are about producing something those that next generation of AI needs to understand the physical world we call it physical AI in order to create physical AI we need three computers and we created three computers to do so the dgx computer which Blackwell for example is is a reference design an architecture for to create things like dgx computers for training the model that model needs a place to be refined it needs a place to learn it needs the place to apply its physical capability it's robotics capability we call that Omniverse a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics where robots can learn to be robots and then when you're done with the training of it that AI model could then run in the actual robotic system that robotic system could be a car it could be a robot it could be AV it could be a autonomous moving robot it could be a a picking arm uh it could be an entire Factory or an entire Warehouse that's robotic and that computer we call agx Jetson agx dgx for training and then Omniverse for doing the digital twin now here here in India we've got a really great ecosystem who is working with us to take this infrastructure take this ecosystem of capabilities to help the world build physical AI systems and you know what I've really loved is adorb is one of the largest robotics company they build Robotics and more importantly they put it in a digital twin where optimization takes place they teach the robo all the inputs that comes out of the physical world not only is that work taking place our system integrators asenta TCS Tech Mahindra are taking that knowledge not only into India but also outside India so do it in India for India and do from India for globe start locally grow globally right right that's fantastic okay thank you thank you thank you very much Michelle thank you thank you we made a short video to help you put everything together that I just said run it please for 60 years software 1.0 code written by programmers ran on general purpose CPUs then software 2.0 arrived machine learning neural networks running on gpus this led to the Big Bang of generative AI models that learn and generate anything today generative AI is revolutionizing $100 trillion in Industries knowledge Enterprises use agentic AI to automate digital work hello I'm James a digital human Industrial Enterprises use physical AI to automate physical work physical AI embodies robots like self-driving cars that safely navigate the real world manipulators that perform complex industrial tasks and humanoid robots who work collaboratively alongside us plants and factories will be embodied by physical AI capable of monitoring and adjusting its operations or speaking to us Nvidia builds three computers to enable developers to create physical AI the models are first trained on dgx then the AI is fine-tuned and tested using reinforcement learning physics feedback in Omniverse and the trained AI runs on Nvidia Jetson agx robotics computers Nvidia Omniverse is a physics-based operating system for physical AI simulation robots learn and fine-tune their skills in Isaac lab a robot gym built on Omniverse this is just one robot future factories will orchestrate teams of robots and monitor entire operations through thousands of sensors for factory digital digal twins they use an Omniverse blueprint called Mega with mega the factory digital twin is populated with virtual robots and their AI models the robots brains the robots execute a task by perceiving their environment reasoning planning their next motion and finally converting it to actions these actions are simulated in the environment by the world simulator in Omniverse and the results are perceived by the robot brains through Omniverse sensor simulation based on the sensor simulations the robot brains decide the next action and the loop continues while Mega precisely tracks the state and position of everything in the factory digital twin this software in the loop testing brings softwar defined processes to physical spaces and embodiments letting Industrial Enterprises simulate and validate changes in an Omniverse digital twin before deploying to the physical world saving massive risk and cost the era of physical AI is here transforming the world's heavy Industries and Robotics [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music]

let's get started good take good take oh oh je okay you guys ready yeah yeah everybody thinks we make GPS I video is so much more than [Music] that this whole keynote is going to be about that okay so we'll start at the top examples of the use cases and then seeing it in action that's kind of the flow in such your compelling story I'm super nervous about this just got to get in the Rhythm we're 2 weeks away from you guys can go really really make it bre we should take a swing at it yeah that's the plan we need to get daily status on that animation can you mute cuz I hear myself sorry what's the drop date for all the videos it needs to be done on the 28th did you get all that safe travels everybody super excited to see everyone see you guys soon okay bye we're basically moving as fast as the world can absorb technology so we've got to LEAP from ourselves [Music] in now the spine you just have to figure out a way to make it pop you know what I'm [Music] saying you know what I'm saying you want to yeah that kind of thing [Music] okay thank you I'm super late let's [Music] go please welcome welcome to the stage Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen [Music] W I am very happy to be back thank you NTU for letting us use your Stadium the last time I was here I received a degree from [Applause] n and I gave the Run don't walk speech and today we have a lot to cover so I cannot walk I must run we have a lot to cover I have many things to tell you I'm very happy to be here in Taiwan Taiwan is the home of our treasured Partners this is in fact where everything Nvidia does begins our partners and ourselves take it to the world Taiwan and our partnership has created the world's AI infrastructure today I want to talk to you about several things one what is happening and the meaning of the work that we do together what is generative AI what is its impact on our industry and on every industry a blueprint for how we will go forward and engage this incredible opportunity and what's coming next generative Ai and its impact our blueprint and what comes next these are really really exciting times a restart of our computer industry an industry that you have forged an IND industry that you have created and now you're prepared for the next major Journey but before we start Nvidia lives at the intersection of computer graphics simulations and artificial intelligence this is our soul everything that I show you today is simulation it's math it's science it's computer science it's amazing computer architecture none of it's animated and it's all homemade this is invidious soul and we put it all into this virtual world we called Omniverse please enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] when doubt [Applause] I want to speak to you in Chinese but I have so much to tell you I have to think too hard to speak Chinese so I have to speak to you in English at the foundation of everything that you saw was two fundamental Technologies accelerated Computing and artificial intelligence running inside the Omniverse those two technologies those two fundamental forces of computing are going to reshape the computer industry the computer industry is now some 60 years old in a lot of ways everything that we do today was invented the year after my birth in 1964 the IBM system 360 introduced central processing units general purpose Computing the separation of hardware and software through an operating system multitasking IO subsystems dma all kinds of technologies that we use today architectural compatibility backwards compa ibility family compatibility all of the things that we know today about Computing largely described in 1964 of course the PC Revolution democratized Computing and put it in the hands and the houses of everybody and then off in 2007 the iPhone introduced mobile Computing and put the computer in our pocket ever since everything is connected and running all the time through the mobile cloud this last 60 years we saw several just several not that many actually two or three major technology shifts two or three tectonic shifts in Computing where everything changed and we're about to see that happen again there are two fundamental things that are happening the first is that the processor the engine by which the computer industry runs on the central processing unit the performance scaling has slowed tremendously and yet the amount of computation we have to do is still doubling very quickly exponentially if processing requirement if the data that is that we need to process continues to scale exponentially but performance does not we will experience computation inflation and in fact we're seeing that right now as we speak the amount of data center power that's used all over the world is growing quite substantially the cost of computing is growing we are seeing computation inflation this of course cannot continue the data is going to continue to increase exponentially and CPU performance scaling will never return there is a better way for almost two decades now we've been working on accelerated Computing Cuda augments a CPU offloads and accelerates the work that A specialized processor can do much much better in fact the performance is so extraordinary that it is very clear now as CPU scaling has slowed and event substantially stopped we should accelerate everything I predict that every application that is processing intensive will be accelerated and surely every data center will be accelerated the near future now accelerated Computing is very sensible it's very common sense if you take a look at an application and here the 100t means 100 units of time it could be 100 seconds it could be 100 hours and in many cases as you know we're now working on artificial intelligence applications that run for a 100 days the ont is code that is requires sequential processing where single-threaded CPUs are really quite essential operating systems control logic really essential to have one instruction executed after another instruction however there are many algorithms computer Graphics is one that you can operate completely in parallel computer Graphics image processing physics simulations combinatorial optimizations graph processing database processing and of course the very famous linear algebra of deep learning there are many types of algorithms that are very conducive to acceleration through parallel processing so we invented an architecture to to do that by adding the GPU to the CPU the specialized processor can take something that takes a great deal of time and accelerate it down to something that is in incredibly fast and because the two processors can work side by side they're both autonomous and they're both separate independent that is we could accelerate what used to take a 100 units of time down to one unit of time well the speed up is incredible it almost sounds unbelievable it almost sounds unbelievable but today I'll demonstrate many examples for you the benefit is quite extraordinary a 100 times speed up but you only increase the power by about a factor of three and you increase the cost by only about 50% we do this all the time in the PC industry we add a GPU a $500 GPU gForce GPU to a $1,000 PC and the performance increases tremendously we do this in a data center a billion dooll data center we add $500 million worth of gpus and all of a sudden it becomes an AI Factory this is happening all over the world today well the savings are quite extraordinary you're getting 60 times performance per dollar a 100 times speed up you only increase your power by 3x 100 times speed up you only increase inre your cost by 1.5x the savings are incredible the savings are measured in dollars it is very clear that many many companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars processing data in the cloud if it was accelerated it is not unexpected that you could save hundreds of millions of dollars now why is that well the reason for that is very clear we've been experiencing inflation for so long in general purpose Computing now that we finally came to we finally determined to accelerate there's an enormous amount of captured loss that we can now regain a great deal of captured retained waste that we can now relieve out of the system and that will translate into savings Savings in money Savings in energy and that's the reason why you've heard me say the more you buy the more you save and now I've shown you the mathematics it is not accurate but it is correct okay that's called CEO math CEO math is not accurate but it is correct the more you buy the more you save well accelerated computing does deliver extraordinary results but it is not easy why is it that it saves so much money but people haven't done it for so long the reason for that is because it's incredibly hard there is no such thing as a software that you can just run through a c compiler and all of a sudden that application runs a 100 times faster that is not even logical if it was possible to do that they would have just changed the CPU to do that you in fact have to rewrite the software that's the hard part the software has to be completely Rewritten so that you could reactor reexpress the algorithms that was written on a CPU so that it could be accelerated offloaded accelerated and run in parallel that computer science exercise is insanely hard well we've made it easy for the world over the last 20 years of course the very famous cdnn the Deep learning library that processes neural networks we have a library for AI physics that you could use for fluid dynamics and many other applications where the neural network has to obey the laws of physics we have a great new library called aerial that is a Cuda accelerated 5G radio so that we can software Define and accelerate the Telecommunications networks the way that we've soft software defined the world world's networking um uh internet and so the ability for us to accelerate that allows us to turn all of Telecom into essentially the same type of platform a Computing platform just like we have in the cloud kitho is a comp computational lithography platform that allows us to uh process the most computationally intensive parts of Chip manufacturing making the mask tsmc is in the process of going to production with k litho saving enormous amounts of energy and more enormous amounts of money but the goal for tsmc is to accelerate their stack so that they're prepared for even further advances in algorithm and more computation for deeper and deeper uh narrow and narrow transistors parab brakes is our Gene sequencing Library it is the highest throughput library in the world for Gene sequencing coopt is an incredible library for combinatorial optimization route planning optimization the traveling salesman problem incredibly complicated people do people have well scientists have largely concluded that you needed a quantum computer to do that we created an algorithm that runs on accelerated Computing that runs Lightning Fast 23 World Records we hold every single major world record today C Quantum is an emulation system for a quantum computer if you want to design a quantum computer comp you need a simulator to do so if you want to design Quantum algorithms you need a Quantum emulator to do so how would you do that how would you design these quantum computers create these Quantum algorithms if the quantum computer doesn't exist while you use the fastest computer in the world that exist today and we call it of course Nvidia Cuda and on that we have an emulator that simulates quantum computers it is used by several hundred thousand researchers around the world it is integrated into all the leading M leading Frameworks for Quantum Computing and is used in scientific super super Computing centers all over the world kdf is an unbelievable library for data processing data processing consumes the vast majority of cloud spend today all of it should be accelerated qdf accelerates the major libraries used in the world spark many of you probably use spark in your companies pandas um a new one called polar and of course uh networkx which is a graph processing graph processing uh database um library and so these are just some examples there are so many more each one of them had to be created so that we can enable the ecosystem to take advantage of accelerated Computing if we hadn't created cudnn Cuda alone wouldn't have been able wouldn't have been possible for of the deep learning scientists around the world to use because Cuda and the algorithms that are used in tensor flow and Pi torch the Deep learning algorithms the separation is too far apart it's almost like trying to do computer Graphics without open G it's almost like doing data processing without SQL these domain specific libraries are really The Treasure of our company we have 350 of them the these libraries Is What It Takes and what has made it possible for us to have such open so many markets I'll show you some other examples today well just last week Google announced that theyve put CDF in the cloud and accelerate pandas pandas is the most popular data science library in the world many of you in here probably already use pandas it's used by 10 million data scientists in the world downloaded 170 million times each month it is the Excel that is the spreadsheet of data scientists well with just one click you can now use pandas in C collab which is Google's cloud data centers platform accelerated by CDF the speed up is really incredible let's take a look [Music] that was a great demo right didn't take [Applause] long when you accelerate data processing that fast demos don't take long okay well Cuda has now achieved what people call a Tipping Point but it's even better than that Cuda has now achieved a virtuous cycle this rarely happens if you look at history and all the Computing architecture Computing Platforms in the case of microprocessor CPUs it has been here for 60 years it has not been changed for 60 years at this level this way of doing Computing accelerated Computing has been around has creating a new platform is extremely hard because it's a chicken and egg problem if there are no developers that use your platform then of course there will be no users but if there are no users there are no install base if they're no install base developers aren't interested in it developers want to write software for a large install base but a large install base requires a lot of applications so that users would create that install base this chicken or the egg problem has rarely been broken and has taken us now 20 years one domain Library after another one acceleration Library another and now we have 5 million developers around the world we serve every single industry from Health Care Financial Services of course the computer industry automotive industry just about every major industry in the world just about every field of science because there are so many customers for our architecture oems and cloud service providers are interested in building our systems system makers am amazing system makers like the ones here in Taiwan are interested in building our systems which then takes and offers more systems to the market which of course creates greater opportunity for us which allows us to increase our scale R&D scale which speeds up the application even more well every single time we speed up the application the cost of computing goes down this is that slide I was showing you earlier 100x speed up translates to 97 96% 98% savings and so when we go from 100x speed up to 200x speed up to a000 X speed up the savings the marginal cost of computing continues to fall well of course we believe that by reducing the cost of computing incredibly the market developers scientists inventors will continue to discover new algorithms that cons consume more and more and more Computing so that one day something happens that a pH shift happens that the marginal cost of computing is so low that a new way of using computers emerge in fact that's what we're seeing now over the years we have driven down the marginal cost of computing in the last 10 years in one particular algorithm by a million times well as a result it is now very logical and very common sense to train large language models with all of the data on the internet nobody thinks twice this idea that you could create a computer that could process so much data to write its own software the emergence of artificial intelligence was made possible because of this complete belief that if we made Computing cheaper and cheaper and cheaper somebody's going to find a great use well today Cuda has achieved the virtual cycle install base is growing Computing cost is coming down which causes more developers to come up with more ideas which drives more demand and now we're on in the beginning of something very very important but before I show you that I want to show you what is not possible if not for the fact that we created Cuda that we created the modern version of General the modern Big Bang of AI generative AI what I'm about to show you would not be possible this is Earth two the idea that we would create a digital twin of the earth that we would go and simulate the Earth so that we could predict the future of our planet to better Aver disasters or better understand the impact of climate change so that we can adapt better so that we could change our habits now this digital twin of Earth is probably one of the most ambitious projects that the world's ever undertaken and we're taking step large steps every single year and I'll show you results every single year but this year we made some great breakthroughs let's take a look on Monday the storm will Veer North again and approach Taiwan there are big uncertainties regarding its path different paths will have different levels of impact on Taiwan forvia Earth [Music] [Music] 2f [Music] for fore cordi AI [Music] Nvidia [Music] [Music] [Applause] someday in the near future we will have continuous weather prediction at every at every Square kilometer on the planet you will always know what the climate's going to be you will always know and this will run continuously because we trained the AI and the AI requires so little energy and so this is just an incredible achievement I hope you you enjoyed it and very importantly uh what [Applause] the truth is that was a Jensen AI that was not me I I wrote I wrote it but an AI Jens AI had to say it because of our dedication to continuously improve the performance of Drive the cost down researchers discover discovered AI researchers discovered Cuda in 2012 that was nvidia's first contact with AI this was a very important day we had the good wisdom to work with the the scientists to make it possible for a deep learning to happen and Alex net achieved of course a tremendous computer vision breakthrough but the great wisdom was to take a step back and understanding what was the background what is the foundation of deep learning what is its long-term impact what is its potential and we realized that this technology has great potential to scale an algorithm that was invented and discovered decades ago all of a sudden because of more data larger networks and very importantly a lot more compute all of a sudden deep learning was able to achieve what no human algorithm was able to now imagine if we were to scale up the architecture even more larger networks more data and more compute what could be possible so we dedicated ourselves to reinvent everything after 2012 we changed the architecture of our GPU to add tensor course we invented MV link that was 10 years ago now CNN tensor RT nickel we bought melanox tensor RT LM the Triton inference server and all of it came together on a brand new computer nobody understood nobody asked for it nobody understood it and in fact I was certain nobody wanted to buy it and so we announced it at GTC and open AI a small company in San Francisco saw it and they asked me to deliver one to them I delivered the first dgx the F the world's first AI supercomputer to open AI in 2016 well after that we continued to scale from one AI supercomputer one AI Appliance we scaled it up to large supercomputers even larger by 2017 the world discovered Transformers so that we could train enormous amounts of data and recognize and learn patterns that are sequential over large spans of time it is now possible for for us to train these large language models to understand and achieve a breakthrough in natural language understanding and we kept going after that we built even larger ones and then in November 2022 trained on thousands tens of thousands of Nvidia gpus in a very large AI supercomputer open AI announced chat GPT 1 million users after five days 1 million after five days a 100 million after two months the fastest growing application in history and the reason for that is very simple it is just so easy to use and it was so magical to use to be able to interact with computer like it's Human Instead of being clear about what you want it's like the computer understands your meaning it understands your intention oh I think here it it um asked the the closest Night Market night as you know U the night market is very important to me so when I was young uh I was I think I was four and a half years old I used to love going to the night mark Market because I I just love watching people and and uh uh and so we went my parents used to take us to the night market uh and and um uh and I love I love U I love going and one day uh my face you guys might might see that I have a large scar on my face my face was cut because somebody was washing their knife and I was a little kid um but my memories of of the Night Market is uh so deep because of that and I used to love I I just I still love going to the night market and I just need to tell you guys this the the Tona Night Market is is really good because there's a lady uh she's been working there for 43 years she's the fruit lady and it's in the middle of the stre the middle between the two go find her okay she [Applause] she's really terrific I think it would be funny after this all of you go to see her she every year she's doing better and better her cart has improved and yeah I just love watching her succeed anyways anyways uh Chad GPT came along and um and something is very important in this slide here let me show you something this slide okay and this Slide the fundamental difference is this until chat GPT revealed it to the world AI was all about perception natural language understanding Compu computer vision speech recognition it's all about perception and detection this was the first time the world saw a generative AI It produced tokens one token at a time and those tokens were words some of the tokens of course could now be images or charts or tables songs words speech videos those tokens could be anything they anything that that you can learn the meaning of it could be tokens of chemicals tokens of proteins genes you saw earlier in Earth 2 we were generating tokens of the weather we can we can learn physics if you can learn physics you could teach an AI model physics the AI model could learn the meaning of physics and it can generate physics we were scaling down to 1 kilometer not by using filtering it was generating and so we can use this method to generate tokens for almost anything almost anything of value we can generate steering wheel control for a car we can generate articulation for a robotic arm everything that we can learn we can now generate we have now arrived not at the AI era but a generative AI era but what's really important is this this computer that started out as a supercomputer has now evolved into a Data Center and it produces one thing it produces tokens it's an AI Factory this AI Factory is generating creating producing something of Great Value a new commodity in the late 1890s Nicola Tesla invented an AC generator we invented an AI generator the AC generator generated electrons nvidia's AI generator generates tokens both of these things have large Market opportunities it's completely fungible in almost every industry and that's why it's a new Industrial Revolution we have now a new Factory producing a new commodity for every industry that is of extraordinary value and the methodology for doing this is quite scalable and the methodology of doing this is quite repeatable notice how quickly so many different AI models generative AI models are being invented literally daily every single industry is now piling on for the very first time the IT industry which is $3 trillion $3 trillion IT industry is about to create something that can directly serve a hundred trillion dollar of Industry no longer just an instrument for information storage or data processing but a factory for generating intelligence for every industry this is going to be a manufacturing industry not a manufacturing industry of computers but using the computers in manufacturing this has never happened before quite an extraordinary thing what led started with accelerated comp Computing led to AI led to generative Ai and now an industrial revolution now the impact to our industry is also quite significant of course we could create a new commodity a new product we call tokens for many Industries but the impact of ours is also quite profound for the very first time as I was saying earlier in 60 years every single layer of computing has been changed from CPUs general purpose Computing to accelerated GPU Computing where the computer needs instructions now computers process llms large language models AI models and whereas the Computing model of the past is retrieval based almost every time you touch your phone some pre-recorded text or pre-recorded image or pre-recorded video is retrieved for you and recomposed based on a recommender system to present it to you based on your habits but in the future your computer will generate as much as possible retrieve only what's necessary and the reason for that is because generated generated data requires less energy to go fetch information generated data also is more contextually relevant it will encode knowledge it will your understanding of you and instead of get that inform information for me or get that file for me you just say ask me for an answer and instead of a tool instead of your computer being a tool that we use the computer will now generate skills it performs tasks and instead of an industry that is producing software was which was a revolu evolutionary idea in the early 90s remember the idea that Microsoft created for packaging software revolutionize the PC industry without packaged software what would we use the PC to do it drove this industry and now we have a new Factory a new computer and what we will run on top of this is a new type of software and we call it Nims Nvidia inference microservices now what what happens is the Nim runs inside this Factory and this Nim is a pre-trained model it's an AI well this AI is of course quite complex in itself but the the Computing stack that runs AIS are insanely complex when you go and use chat GPT underneath their stack is a whole bunch of software underneath that prompt is a ton of software and it's incredibly complex because the models are large billions to trillions of parameters it doesn't run on just one computer it runs on multiple computers it has to distribute the workload across multiple gpus tensor parallelism pipeline parallelism data parallel all kinds of parallelism expert parallelism all kinds of parallelism Distributing the workload across multiple gpus processing it as fast as possible because if you are in a factory if you run a factory your throughput directly correlates to your revenues your throughput directly correlates to quality of service and your throughput directly correlates to number of people who can use your service we are now in a world where data center throughput utilization is vitally important it was important in the past but not Vally important it was important in the past but people don't measure it today every par parameter is measured start time uptime utilization throughput idle time you name it because it's a factory when something is a factory its operations directly correlate to the financial performance of the company and so we realized that this is incredibly complex for most companies to do so what we did was we created this AI in a box and it containers an incredible amounts of software inside this container is Cuda cudnn tensor RT Triton for inference Services it is cloud native so that you could Auto scale in a kubernetes environment it has Management Services and hooks so that you can monitor your AIS it has common apis standard apis so that you could literally chat with this box you download this Nim and you can talk to it so long as you have Cuda on your computer which is now of course everywhere it's in every cloud available from every computer maker it is available in hundreds of millions of PCS when you download this you have an AI and you can chat with it like chat GPT all of the software is now integrated 400 dependencies all integrated into one we tested this Nim each one of these pre-trained models against all kind are Tire install base that's in the cloud all the different versions of Pascal and ampers and Hoppers and all kinds of different versions I even forget some Nims incredible invention this is one of my favorites and of course as you know we now have the ability to create large language models and pre-trained models of all kinds and we we have all of these various versions whether it's language based or Vision based or Imaging based or we have versions that are available for healthc care digital biology we have versions that are digital humans that I'll talk to you about and the way you use this just come to ai. nvidia.com and today we uh just posted up in hugging face the Llama 3 Nim fully optimized it's available there for you to try and you can even take it with you it's available to you for free and so you could run it in the cloud run it in any Cloud you could download this container put it into your own Data Center and you could host it make it available for your customers we have as I mentioned all kinds of different domains physics some of it is for semantic retrieval called Rags Vision languages all kinds of different languages and the way that you use it is connecting these microservices into large applications one of the most important applications in the coming future of course is customer service agents customer service agents are necessary in just about every single industry it represents trillions of dollars of of customer service around the world nurses are customer service agents um in some ways some of them are nonprescription or or non Diagnostics um based nurses are essentially customer service uh customer service for retail for uh Quick Service Foods Financial Services Insurance just tens and tens of millions of customer service can now be augmented by language models and augumented by Ai and so these one these boxes that you see are basically Nims some of the NIMS are reasoning agents given a task figure out what the miss is break it down into a plan some of the NIMS retrieve information some of the NIMS might uh uh uh go and do search some of the NIMS uh might use a tool like kuop that I was talking about earlier they could use a tool that uh could be running on sap and so it has to learn a particular uh language called abap maybe some Nims have to uh uh do SQL queries and so all of these Nims are experts that are now assembled as a team so what's happening the application layer has been changed what used to be applications written with instructions are now applications that are assembling teams assembling teams of AIS very few people know how to write programs almost everybody knows how to break down a problem and assemble teams very every company I believe in the future will have a large collection of Nims and you would bring down the experts that you want you connect them into a team and you you don't even have to figure out exactly how to connect them you just give the mission to an agent to a Nim to figure out who to break the task down and who to give it to and they that a that Central the leader of the of the application if you will the leader of the team would break down the task and give it to the various team members the team members would do their perform their task bring it back to the team leader the team leader would reason about that and present an information back to you just like humans this is in our near future this is the way applications are going to look now of course we could interact with these large these AI services with text prompts and speech prompts however there are many applications where we would like to interact with what what is otherwise a humanlike form we call them digital humans Nvidia has been working on digital human technology for some time let me show it to you and well before I do that hang on a second before I do that okay digital humans has the potential of being a great interact Interactive with you they make much more engaging they could be much more empathetic and of course um we have to uh uh cross this incredible Chasm this uncanny Chasm of realism so that the digital humans would appear much more natural this is of course our vision this is a vision of where we love to go uh but let me show you where we are great to be in Taiwan before I head out to the night market let's dive into some exciting frontiers of digital humans imagine a future where computers interact with us just like humans can hi my name is Sophie and I am a digital human brand ambassador for Unique this is the incredible reality of digital humans digital humans will revolutionize industries from customer service to advertising and ging the possibilities for digital humans are endless using the scans you took of your current kitchen with your phone they will be AI interior designers helping generate beautiful photorealistic suggestions and sourcing the materials and Furniture we have generated several design options for you to choose from they'll also be AI customer service agents making the interaction more engaging and personalized or digital healthcare workers who will check on patients providing Timely personalized care um I did forget to mention to the doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications the antibiotics you've been prescribed cicin and metronidazol don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them and they'll even be AI brand ambassadors setting the next marketing and advertising Trends hi I'm EMA Japan's first virtual model new breakthroughs in generative Ai and computer Graphics let digital humans see understand and interact with us in humanlike ways H from what I can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup the foundation of digital humans are AI models built on multilingual speech recognition and synthesis and llms that understand and generate conversation the AIS connect to another generative AI to dynamically animate a lifelike 3D mesh of a face and finally AI models that reproduce lifelike appearances enabling real-time path traced subsurface scattering to simulate the way light penetrates the skin scatters and exits at various points giving skin its soft and translucent appearance Nvidia Ace is a suite of digital human Technologies packaged as easy to deploy fully optimized microservices or Nims developers can integrate Ace Nims into their existing Frameworks engines and digital human experiences neotron slm and llm Nims to understand our intent and orchestrate other models Reva speech Nims for interactive speech and translation audio to face and gesture Nims for facial and body animation an Omniverse RTX with dlss for neuro rendering of skin and hair Ace Nims run on Nvidia gdn a Global Network of Nvidia accelerated infrastructure that delivers low latency digital human processing to over 100 regions Kaa [Applause] pretty incredible well those those Ace runs in a cloud but it also runs on PCS we had the good wisdom of including tensor core gpus in all of RTX so we've been shipping AI gpus for some time preparing ourselves for this day the reason for that is very simple we always knew that in order to create a new Computing platform you need to install Bas first eventually the application will come if you don't create the install base how could the application come and so if you build it they might not come but if you build it if you don't build it they cannot come and so we installed every single RTX GPU with tensor core G tensor core processing and now we have 100 million GeForce RTX AIP PCS in the world and we're shipping 200 and this this compy Tex wor featuring four new amazing laptops all of them are able to run AI your future laptop your future PC will become an AI it'll be constantly helping you assisting you in the background the PC will also run applications that are enhanced by AI of course all your photo editing and your writing and your tools all the things that you use will all be enhanced by Ai and your PC will also host applications with digital humans that are AIS and so there are different ways that AIS will manifest themselves and become used in PCS but PCS will become very important AI platform and so where do we go from here I spoke earlier about the scaling of our data centers and every single time we scaled we found a new phase change when we scaled from dgx into large AI supercomputers we enabled Transformers to be able to train on enormously large data data sets well what happened was in the beginning the data was human supervised it required human labeling to train AIS unfortunately there is only so much you can human label Transformers made it possible for unsupervised learning to happen now Transformers just look at an enormous amount of data or look at enormous amount of video or look at enormous amount of uh images and it can learn from studying an enormous amount of data find the patterns and relationships itself while the next generation of AI needs to be physically based most of the AIS today uh don't understand the laws of physics it's not grounded in the physical world in order for us to generate uh uh images and videos and 3D graphics and many physics phenomenons we need AIS that are physically based and understand the laws of physics well the way that you could do that is of course learning from video is One Source another way is synthetic data simulation data and another way is using computers to learn with each other this is really no different than using alphao having alphao play itself selfplay and between the two capabilities same capabilities playing each other for a very long period of time they emerge even smarter and so you're going to start to see this type of AI emerging well if the AI data is synthetically generated and using reinforcement learning it stands to reason that the rate of data generation will continue to advance and every single time data generation grows the amount of computation that we have to offer needs to grow with it we are about to enter a phase where AIS can learn the laws of physics and understand and be grounded in physical world data and so we expect that models will continue to grow and we need larger gpus well Blackwell was designed for this generation this is Blackwell and has several very important Technologies uh one of course is just the size of the chip we took two of the largest a chip that is as large as you can make it at tsmc and we connected two of them together with a 10 terabytes per second link between the world's most advanced cies connecting these two together we then put two of them on a computer node connected with a gray CPU the gray CPU could be used for several things in the training situation it could use it could be used for fast checkpoint and restart in the case of inference and generation could be used for storing context memory so that the AI has memory and understands uh the context of the the conversation you would like to have it's our second generation Transformer engine Transformer engine allows us to adapt dynamically to a lower precision based on the Precision and the range necessary for that layer of computation uh this is our second generation GPU that has secure AI so that you could you could ask your service provider to protect your AI from being either stolen from theft or tampering this is our fifth generation MV link MV link allows us to connect multiple gpus together and I'll show you more of that in a second and this is also our first generation with a reliability and availability engine this system this Ras system allows us to test every single transistor flip-flop memory on chip memory off chip so that we can in the field determine whether a particular chip is uh failing the mtbf the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 10,000 gpus is a measured in hours the meantime between failure of a supercomputer with 100,000 gpus is measured in minutes and so the ability for a supercomputer to run for a long period of time and train a model that could last for several months is practically impossible if we don't invent Technologies to enhance its reliability reliability would of course enhance its uptime which directly affects the cost and then lastly decompression engine data processing is one of the most important things we have to do we added a data compression engine decompression engine so that we can pull data out of storage 20 times faster than what's possible today well all of this repres presents Blackwell and I think we have one here that's in production during GTC I showed you Blackwell in a prototype State um the other side this is why we practice [Laughter] ladies and gentlemen this is Blackwell black Blackwell is in production incredible amounts of Technology this is our production board this is the most complex highest performance computer the world's ever made this is the great CPU and these are you could see each one of these blackw dieses two of them connected together you see that it is the largest die the largest chip the world makes and then we connect two of them together with a 10 terabyte per second link okay and that makes the Blackwell computer and the performance is incredible take a look at this so um you see you see our uh the the computational the flops the AI flops uh for each generation has increased by a thousand times in eight years Mo's law in eight years is something along the lines of oh I don't know maybe 40 60 and in the last eight years Moors law has gone a lot lot less and so just to compare even Moors law at its best of times compared to what Blackwell could do so the amount of computations is incredible and when whenever we bring the computation High the thing that happens is the cost goes down and I'll show you what we've done is we've increased through its computational capability the energy used to train a gp4 2 trillion parameter 8 trillion Tokens The amount of energy that is used has gone down by 350 times Well Pascal would have taken 1,000 gwatt hours 1,000 gwatt hours means that it would take a gigawatt data center the world doesn't have a gigawatt data center but if you had a gigawatt data center it would take a month if you had 100 watt 100 megawatt data center it would take about a year and so nobody would of course um uh create such a thing and um and that's the reason why these large language models chat GPT was impossible only eight years ago by us driving down the increasing the performance the energy efficent while keeping and improving energy efficent efficiency along the way we've now taken with Blackwell what used to be 1,000 gwatt hours to three an incredible Advance uh 3 gwatt hours if it's a if it's a um uh uh a 10,000 gpus for example it would only take a coule 10,000 gpus I guess it would take a few days 10 days or so so the amount of advance in just eight years is incredible well this is for inference this is for token generation Our token generation performance has made it possible for us to drive the energy down by three 45,000 times 177,000 Jewels per token that was Pascal 177,000 Jewels it's kind of like two light bulbs running for two days it would take two light bulbs running for two days amounts of energy 200 Watts running for two days to generate one token of gp4 it takes about three tokens to generate one word and so the amount of energy used necessary for Pascal to generate gp4 and have a chat GPT experience with you was practically impossible but now we only use 0.4 Jew per token and we can generate tokens at incredible rates and very little energy okay so Blackwell is just an enormous lead well even so it's not big enough and so we have to build even larger machines and so the way that we build it is called dgx so this is this is our Blackwell chips and it goes into dgx systems that's why we should practice so this is a dgx Blackwell this has this is air cooled has eight of these gpus inside look at the size of the heat sinks on these gpus about 15 kilowatt 15,000 watts and completely air cooled this version supports x86 and it's it goes into the infrastructure that we've been shipping Hoppers into however if you you would like to have liquid cooling we have a new system and this new system is based on this board and we call it mgx for modular and this modular system you won't be able to see this this can they see this can you see this you can the are you okay I say and so this is the mgx system and here's the two uh black Blackwell boards so this one node has four Blackwell chips these four Blackwell chips this is liquid cooled nine of them nine of them uh well 72 of these 72 of these gpus 72 of these G gpus are then connected together with a new MV link this is MV link switch fifth generation and the mvlink switch is a technology Miracle this is the most advanced switch the world's ever made the data rate is insane and these switches connect every single one of these black Wells to each other so that we have one giant 72 GPU Blackwell well the benefit the benefit of this is that in one domain one GPU domain this now looks like one GPU this one GPU has 72 versus the last generation of eight so we increased it by nine times the amount of bandwidth we've increased by 18 times the AI flops we've increased by 45 times and yet the amount of power is only 10 times this is 100 kilowatt and that is 10 kilow and that's for one now of course well you could always connect more of these together and I'll show you how to do that in a second but what's the miracle is this chip this MV link chip people are starting to awaken to the importance of this mvlink chip as it connects all these different gpus together because the large language models are so large it doesn't fit on just one GPU doesn't fit on one just just one node it's going to take the entire rack of gpus like this new dgx that I that I was just standing next to uh to to hold a large language model that are tens of trillions of parameters large mvlink which in itself is a technology Miracle is 50 billion transistors 74 ports at 400 gbits each four lengths cross-sectional bandwidth of 7 7.2 terabytes per second but one of the important things is that it has mathematics inside the switch so that we can do reductions which is really important in deep learning right on the Chip And so this is what this is what um a dgx looks like now and a lot of people ask us um you know they say and there's this there's this confusion about what Nvidia does and and um how is it possible that that Nvidia became so big building gpus and so there's an impression that this is what a GPU looks like now this is a GPU this is one of the most advanced gpus in the world but this is a gamer GPU but you and I know that this is what a GPU looks like this is one GPU ladies and gentlemen dgx GPU you know the back of this GPU is the MV link spine the MV link spine is 5,000 wires two miles and it's right here this is an mvlink spine and it connects 702 gpus to each other this is a electrical mechanical Miracle the transceivers makes it possible for us to drive the entire length in Copper and as a result this switch the mvy switch mvlink switch driving the mvlink spine in Copper makes it possible for us to save 20 kilow in one rack 20 kilowatts could now be used for processing just an incredible achievement so this is the the MV links [Applause] spine wow I went down today and if you and even this is not big enough even this is not big enough for AI factories so we have to connect it all together with very high-speed networking well we have two types of networking we have infin band which has been used uh in supercomputing and AI factories all over the world and it is growing incredibly fast for us however not every data center can handle infiniband because they've already invested their ecosystem in Ethernet for too long and it does take some specialty and some expertise to manage infiniband switches and infiniband networks and so what we've done is we've brought the capabilities of infiniband to the ethernet architecture which is incredibly hard and the reason for that is this ethernet was designed for high average throughput because every single note every single computer is connected to a different person on the internet and most of the communications is the data center with somebody on the other side of the internet however deep learning in AI factories the gpus are not communicating with people on the internet mostly it's communicating with each other they're communicating with each other because they're all they're collecting partial products and they have to reduce it and then redistribute it chunks of partial products reduction redistribution that traffic is incredibly bursty and it is not the average throughput that matters it's the last arrival that matters because if you're reducing collecting partial products from everybody if I'm trying to take all of your so it's not the average throughput it's whoever gives me the answer last okay ethernet has no provision for that and so there are several things that we had to create we created an endtoend architecture so that the the Nick and the switch can communicate and we applied four different Technologies to make this possible number one Nvidia has the world's most advanced RDMA and so now we have the ability to have a network level RDMA for ethernet that is incredibly great number two we have congestion control the switch does Telemetry at all times incredibly fast and whenever the uh the uh the the gpus or the the Nyx are sending too much information we can tell them to back off so that it doesn't create hotspots number three adaptive routing ethernet needs to transmit and receive in order we see congestions or we see uh ports that are not currently being used irrespective of the ordering we will send it to the available ports and Bluefield on the other end reorders it so that it comes back in order that adaptive routing incredibly powerful and then lastly noise isolation there's more than one model being trained or something happening in the data center at all times and their noise and their traffic could get into each other and causes Jitter and so when it when the noise of one training model one model training causes the last arrival to end up too late it really slows down to training well overall remember you have you have built A5 billion dollar or3 billion doll Data Center and you're using this for training if the utilization Network utilization was 40% lower and as a result the training time was 20% longer the5 billion data center is effectively like a$6 billion doll data center so the cost is incredible the cost impact is quite High ethernet with Spectrum X basically allows us to improve the performance so much that the network is basically free and so this is really quite an achievement we're very we have a whole pipeline of ethernet products behind us this is Spectrum x800 it is uh 51.2 terabits per second and 256 radic the next one coming is 512 radic is one year from now 512 Radix and that's called Spectrum x800 Ultra and the one after that is x1600 but the important idea is this x800 is designed for tens of thousands tens T of thousands of gpus x800 ultra is designed for hundreds of thousands of gpus and x1600 is designed for millions of gpus the days of millions of GPU data centers are coming and the reason for that is very simple of course we want to train much larger models but very importantly in the future almost every interaction you have with the Internet or with a computer will likely have a generative AI running in the cloud somewhere and that generative AI is working with you interacting with you generating videos or images or text or maybe a digital human and so you're interacting with your computer almost all the time and there's always a generative AI connected to that some of it is on Prem some of it is on your device and a lot of it could be in the cloud these generative AIS will also do a lot of reasoning capability instead of just one shot answer they might iterate on answers so that it improve the quality of the answer before they give it to you and so the amount of generation we're going to do in the future is going to be extraordinary let's take a look at all of this put together now tonight this is our first nighttime keyote I want to thank I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight at 7:00 and and so what I'm about to show you has a new Vibe okay there's a new Vibe this is kind of the nighttime keynote Vibe so enjoy this black [Music] let's go go go go go okay [Music] [Music] [Music] come on yeah yeah yeah yeah get it y get it y let's go [Music] [Applause] the more you back the more you sa with top ey Tor made that's to speed a [Music] [Applause] now you can't do that on a morning keynote I think that style of keynote has never been done in compy Tex ever might be the last only Nvidia can pull off that only I could do that [Applause] Blackwell of course uh is the first generation of Nvidia platforms that was launched at the beginning at the right as the world knows the generative AI era is here just as the world realized the importance of AI factories just as the beginning of this new Industrial Revolution uh we have so much support nearly every OEM every computer maker every CSP every GPU Cloud Sovereign clouds even telecommunication companies Enterprises all over the world the amount of success the amount of adoption the amount of of uh enthusiasm for Blackwell is just really off the charts and I want to thank everybody for that we're not stopping there uh during this during the time of this incredible growth we want to make sure that we continue to enhance performance continue to drive down cost cost of training cost of inference and continue to scale out AI capabilities for every company to embrace the further we the further performance we drive up the Greater the cost decline Hopper platform of course was the most successful data center processor probably in history and this is just an incredible incredible success story however Blackwell is here and every single platform as you'll notice are several things you got the CPU you have the GPU you have MV link you have the Nick and you have the switch the the mvlink switch the uh connects all of the gpus together as large of a domain as we can and whatever we can do we connect it with large um very large and very highspeed switches every single generation as you'll see is not just a GPU but it's entire platform we build the entire platform we integrate the entire platform into an AI Factory supercomputer however then we this aggregate it and offer it to the world and the reason for that is because all of you could create interesting and Innovative configurations and and and all kinds of different uh uh Styles and and fit different uh data centers and different customers in different places some of it for Edge some of it for Telco and all of the different Innovation are POS possible if it would we made the systems open and make it possible for you to innovate and so we design it integrated but we offer it to you disintegrated so that you could create modular systems the Blackwell platform is here our company is on a one-year Rhythm we our basic philosophy is very simple one build the entire data center scale disaggregated and sell it to you in Parts on a one-year Rhythm and we push everything the technology limits whatever tsmc process technology will push it to the absolute limits whatever packaging technology push it to the absolute limits whatever memory technology push it to Absolute limits series technology Optics technology everything is pushed to the Limit well and then after that do everything in such a way so that all of our software runs on this entire install base software inertia is the single most important thing in computers it'll when a computer is backwards compatible and it's architecturally compatible with all the software that has already been created your ability to go to market is so much faster and so the velocity is incredible when we can take advantage of the entire installed base of software has already been created well Blackwell is here next year is Blackwell Ultra just as we had h100 and h200 you'll probably see some pretty exciting New Generation from us for black Blackwell Ultra again again push to the limits and the Next Generation Spectrum switches I mentioned well this is the very first time that this next click has been made and I'm not sure yet whe I'm going to regret this or [Applause] not we have code names in our company and uh we try to keep them very secret uh often times uh most of the employees don't even know but our next Generation platform is called Reuben the Reuben platform the Reuben platform um I'm I'm not going to spend much time on it uh I know what's going to happen you're going to take pictures of it and you're going to go look at the fine prints uh and feel free to do that so we have the Reuben platform and one year later we' have the Reuben um Ultra platform all of these chips that I'm showing you here are all in full development 100% of them and the rhythm is one year at the limits of Technology all 100% architecturally compatible so this is this is basically what Nvidia is building and all of the riches of software on top of it so in a lot of ways the last 12 years from that moment of imag net and US realizing that the future of computing was going to radically change to today is really exactly as I was holding up earlier GeForce pre 20102 and Nvidia today the company has really transformed tremendously and I want to thank all of our partners here for supporting us every step along the way this is the Nvidia black wall platform let me talk about what's next the next wave of AI is physical AI AI that understands the laws of physics AI that can work among us and so they have to understand the world model so that they understand how to interpret the world how to perceive the world they have to of course have excellent cognitive capabilities so they can understand us understand what we asked and perform the tasks in the future robotics is a much more p pervasive idea of course when I say robotics there's a humanoid robotics that's usually the representation of that but that's not at all true everything is going to be robotic all of the factories will be robotic the factories will orchestrate robots and those robots will be building products that are robotic robots interacting with robots building products that are robotic well in order for us to do that we need to make some breakthroughs and let me show you the video the era of Robotics has arrived one day everything that moves will be autonomous researchers and companies around the world are developing robots powered by physical AI physical AIS are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world multimodal llms are breakthroughs that enable robots to learn perceive and understand the world around them and plan how they'll act and from Human demonstrations robots can now learn the skills required to interact with the world using gross and fine motor skills one of the integral Technologies for advancing robotics is reinforcement learning just as llms need rhf or reinforcement learning from Human feedback to learn particular skills generative physical AI can learn skills using reinforcement learning from physics feedback in a simulated World these simulation environments are where robots learn to make decisions by performing actions in a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics in these robot gyms a robot can learn to perform complex and dynamic tasks safely and quickly refining their skills through millions of Acts of trial and error we built Nvidia Omniverse as the operating system where physical a can be created Omniverse is a development platform for virtual world simulation combining realtime physically based rendering physics simulation and generative AI Technologies in Omniverse robots can learn how to be robots they learn how to autonomously manipulate objects with Precision such as grasping and handling objects or navigate environments autonomously finding optimal paths while avoiding obstacles and Hazards learning in Omniverse minimizes the Sim to real Gap and maximizes the transfer of learned beh Behavior building robots with generative physical AI requires three computers Nvidia AI supercomputers to train the models Nvidia Jetson Orin and Next Generation Jetson Thor robotic supercomputer to run the models an Nvidia Omniverse where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds we build the platforms acceleration libraries and AI models needed by developers and companies and allow them to use any or all of the stacks that suit them best the next wave of AI is here robotics powered by physical AI will revolutionize [Music] Industries this isn't the future this is happening now there are several ways that we're going to serve the market the first we're going to create platforms for each type of robotic systems one for robotic factories and warehouses one for robots that manipulate things one for robots that move and one for uh robots that are humanoid and so each one of these robotic robotics platform is like almost everything else we do a computer acceler libraries and pre-train models computers acceleration libraries pre-train models and we test everything we train everything and integrate everything inside Omniverse where Omniverse is as the video was saying where robots learn how to be robots now of course the ecosystem of robotic warehouses is really really complex it takes a lot of companies a lot of tools a lot of technology to build a modern warehouse and warehouses are increasingly robotic one of these things days will be fully robotic and so in each one of these ecosystems we have sdks and apis that are connected into the software industry sdks and apis connected into Edge AI industry um and companies and then also of course uh systems that are designed for plc's and robotic systems for the odms it's then integrated by integrators uh created for ultimately uh building warehouses uh for customers here we have an example of kenmac building a robotic warehouse for giant giant group okay and then here now let's talk about factories factories has a completely different ecosystem and foxcon is building some of the world's most advanced factories their ecosystem again Edge Computers and Robotics software for designing the factories the workflows programming the robots and of course PLC computers that orchestrate uh the digital factories and the AI factories we have sdks uh that are connected into each one of these ecosystems as well this is happening all over Taiwan foxcon has buil is building digital twins of their factories Delta is building digital twins of their factories by the way half is real half half is digital half is Omniverse pegatron is building digital twins of their robotic factories wistron is building digital twins of their robotic factories and this is really cool this is a video of foxc con's new Factory let's take a look demand for NVIDIA accelerated Computing is skyrocketing as the World modernizes traditional data centers into generative AI factories foxcon the world's largest electronics manufacturer is gearing up to meet this Demand by building robotic factories with Nvidia Omniverse and AI Factory planners use Omniverse to integrate facility and Equipment data from leading industry applications like seamen team Center X and Autodesk Revit in the digital twin they optimize floor layout and line configurations and locate optimal camera placements to monitor future operations with Nvidia Metropolis powered Vision AI virtual integration saves planners on the enormous cost of physical change orders during construction the foxcon teams use the digital twin as the source of Truth to communicate and validate accurate equipment layout the Omniverse digital twin is also the robot gym where foxcon developers train and test Nvidia ISAC AI applications for robotic perception and manipulation and Metropolis AI applications for Sensor Fusion in Omniverse foxcon simulates two robot AIS before deploying run times to Jets and computers on the assembly line they simulate Isaac manipulator libraries and AI models for automated Optical inspection for object identification defect detection and trajectory planning to transfer hgx systems to the test pods they simulate Isaac perceptor powered fobot amrs as they perceive and move about their environment with 3D mapping and reconstruction with Omniverse foxcon builds their robotic factories that orchestrate robots running on Nvidia ISAC to build Nvidia AI supercomputers which which in turn train boxon [Music] [Applause] robots so a robotic Factory is designed with three computers train the AI on Nvidia AI you have the robot running on the PLC systems uh for orchestrating the the the uh the factories and then you of course simulate everything inside Omniverse well the robotic arm and the robotic amrs are also the same way three computer systems the difference is the two omniverses will come together so they'll share one virtual space when they share one virtual space that robotic arm will become inside the robotic Factory and again three three uh three computers and we provide the computer the acceleration layers and pre-train uh pre-train AI models we've connected Nvidia manipulator and Nvidia Omniverse with Seamans the world's leading Industrial Automation software and systems company this is really a fantastic partnership and they're working on factories all over the world semantic pick aai now integrates Isaac manipulator and sematic pick AI uh runs operates ABB CA yasawa uh Fook uh Universal robotics um and techman and so semmens is a fantastic integration we have all kinds of other Integrations let's take a look arcbest is integrating Isaac perceptor into Vox smart autonomy robots for enhanced object recognition and human motion tracking in Material Handling byd Electronics is integrating Isaac manipulator and percep ctor into their AI robots to enhance manufacturing efficiencies for Global customers ideal works is building Isaac perceptor into their iwos software for AI robots in Factory Logistics intrinsic an alphabet company is adopting Isaac manipulator into their Flow State platform to advance robot grasping Gideon is integrating Isaac perceptor into Trey AI powered forklifts to advance AI enabled Logistics Argo robotics is adopting Isaac perceptor into perception engine for Advanced Vision based amrs Solomon is using Isaac manipulator AI models in their acup piic 3D software for industrial manipulation techman robot is adopting Isaac Sim and manipulator into TM flow accelerating automated Optical inspection pteridine robotics is integrating Isaac manipulator into po scope X for cobots and Isaac perceptor into mere amrs vention is integrating Isaac manipulator into machine Logic for AI manipulation [Music] robots robotics is here physical AI is here this is not science fiction and it's being used all over Taiwan and just really really exciting and that's the factory the robots inside and of course all the products are going to be robotics there are two very high volume robotics products one of course is the self-driving car or cars that have a great deal of autonomous capability Nvidia again builds the entire stack next year we're going to go to production with the Mercedes Fleet and after that in 2026 the jlr fleet uh we offer the full stack to the world however you're welcome to take whichever Parts uh which whichever layer of our stack just as the entire the entire uh uh Drive stack is open the next high volume robotics product that's going to be manufactured by robotic factories with robots inside will likely be humanoid robots and this has great progress in recent years in both the cognitive capability because of foundation models and also the world understanding capability that we're in the process of developing I'm really excited about this area because obviously the easiest robot to adapt into the world are human or robots because we built the world for us we also have the vast the most amount of data to train these robots than other types of robots because we have the same uh physique and so the amount of training data we can provide through demonstration capabilities and video capabilities is going to be really great and so we're going to see a lot of progress in this area well I think we have um some robots that we' like to uh welcome there we go about my [Applause] size and we have we have some friends to join us so the fut the future of robot robotics is here the next wave of AI and and of course you know Taiwan builds computers with keyboards you build computers for your pocket you build computers for data centers in the cloud in the future you're going to build computers that walk and computers that roll you know around and um so these are all just computers and as as it turns out uh the technology is very similar to the technology of building um all of the other computers that you already build today so this is going to be a really extraordinary uh Journey for us well uh I want to thank I want to I want to thank I want to I have I've I've made one last video if you don't mind uh something that that uh uh uh we we really enjoyed making um and if you let's run it [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you I love you guys thank [Applause] you thank you all for coming have a great comput text thank [Applause] you I will make you like me yeah singing with me [Music] once again a come T we will show you all about best yeah digital dreams and me with to all of in Tai we hope that you like this song yeah good me and [Music] [Music] once get thank you for joining us yeah digal Twins and me we been I [Music] feeled hey I am awake for the new day feeling the sun upon my face I'm all the bad vibes away look to the sky I have this moment inside the glove I am the Sun up so high above I am the star you are thinking know take a minute now take a minute to see take a minute now we are put in the SE this is everything that I could ever KN on the top again in the land of the free and e e e hello everyone welcome sigraph it is my first sigraph I'm so excited to be here I'm so excited to speak to all of you and I'm so excited to speak to Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen hang great to see you again thank you great to see you welcome to sigraph Lauren Welcome To My Hood you're regular here huh hey everybody great to see you guys Jensen it is like 99 degrees outside I know it's freezing in here isn't it I mean I don't know I'm shaking leather jacket yeah feels great looks good too all right so you have I'm wearing a brand new one oh a brand new one yeah how many of those do you have I don't know but Lori got me a new one for sigraph she said you're excited about cigar here's a new jacket go go do good job I look sharp thank you all right uh you have a long history of sigraph I mean when you think about the history of this conference which has been going on since 1974 and you think about the history of Nvidia from the 1990s onward where your DNA was really in you know know computer Graphics uh helping to make beautiful Graphics what is the significance of Nvidia being here today right now at a conference like sigraph well you know uh sigraph used to be about computer Graphics now it's about computer graphics and generative AI it's about simulation it's about generative Ai and and we all know that the Journey of Nvidia which started out in computer Graphics as you said um uh really brought us here and so I made a cartoon for you I made a cartoon for you of our journey did you make it or did J of AI make it I I I had it hang on a second I had it made I had it made um that's what CEOs do we don't do anything we just have it be done it kind of starts something like this hey guys would it be great if we had a cartoon and it Illustrated some of the most important milestones in the computer industry and how it led to Nvidia and where we are today and and so we Illustrated and also do it in three hours and do three hours right and and so this is this cartoon here is really terrific so these are some of the some of the most important moments in the computer industry uh the IBM system 360 of course the invention of modern Computing uh the teapot 1975 the Utah teapot 1979 Ray tracing um uh Turner wited uh one of the great researchers Nvidia researcher for a long time uh 1986 programmable shading uh of course uh most of the animated movies that we see today wouldn't be possible if not for programmable shading originally done on the CRA supercomputer uh led to uh what and then in 1993 Nvidia was founded Chris Curtis and I founded the company 19 1995 Windows PC revolutionized uh the personal computer industry uh put a personal computer in every home and every desk uh multimedia PC was uh was invented 2001 we invented uh the first programmable shading GPU and and that that really uh drove uh vast majority of nvidia's Journey up to that point But at the background of everything we were doing was accelerated computing and accelerate and and we believe that you could create a type of computing model that could augment the general purpose Computing so that you can solve problems that normal computers can't and the application we chose first was computer graphics and it was probably one of the best decisions we ever made because computer Graphics was insanely computationally in intensive and remained so uh for the entire 31 years that that Nvidia has been here and since the beginning of computer Graphics in fact required a crazy supercomputer to render some of the original scenes so it kind of tells you how computationally intensive it was and it was also incredibly high volume because we applied computer Graphics to an application at the time that uh wasn't mainstream 3D Graphics video games the combination of very large volume very complicated Computing problem led to a very large R&D budget for us which drove the flywheel of our company that observation we made in 1993 was spoton and it led us to be able to Pioneer the work that we're doing in accelerated Computing we tried it many times Cuda was of course the Revolutionary version but prior to that we had a Computing model we call CG C for graphics C on top of gpus and so we've been working on accelerated Computing for a long time uh promoting and evangelizing Cuda getting Cuda everywhere and putting on every single one of our gpus so that this computing model was compatible with the with any application that was written for it irrespective of which generation of our processors that was a great decision and one one day in 2012 we made our first Contact you know Star Trek first Contact with artificial intelligence that first Contact was alexnet it was in 2012 very big moment uh we made the observation that alexnet was an incredible breakthrough in computer vision but at the core of it deep learning was deeply profound that it was a new way of writing software instead of Engineers given input imagining what the output was going to be write algorithms we now have a computer that given an input and example outputs would figure out what the program is in the middle that observation and that we can use this technique to solve a whole bunch of problems that previously wasn't solvable was a great observation and we changed everything in our company to pursue it from the processor to the systems to the software stack all the algorithms Nvidia basic research pivoted towards working on deep learning uh by the way this is a great place for research as you know nvidia's uh passionate about about uh uh sigraph and this year we have 20 papers that are at the intersection of generative Ai and simulation and so in 20 2016 uh we introduced the first computer we built for deep learning and we called it djx1 and I delivered the first djx1 outside of our company I built it for NVIDIA to build models for self-driving cars and Robotics and such and and generative AI for graphics uh but we uh somebody saw an example of djx1 Elon reached out to me and said hey I would love to have one of those for a startup company we're starting and so I delivered the first one to a company at the time uh that knew nobody knew about called open a I and so that was 2016 uh 2017 was the Transformer uh that revolutionized modern uh machine learning modern deep learning in 2018 right here at sigraph we announced RTX the world's first realtime interactive R Tracer R tracing platform we call it RTX it was such a big deal that we changed the name of GTX which everybody refer to our graphics cards as to RTX uh another shout out for for uh uh a great researcher his name is Steph Parker uh many of you know he's been coming to C for a long time uh he passed this year and uh he was a a he was one of the one of the core uh Pioneer researchers behind realtime R raate tracing and we miss them dearly and so anyways uh and you mentioned last year during your sigraph keynote that RTX R tracing extreme was one of the big important moments when computer Graphics met AI That's right but that had been happening for a while actually so what was so what was so important about RTX in 2018 well RTX in 2018 so you know we uh we accelerated uh Ray traversal and bounding box uh detection and and um uh and we made it possible to uh use a parallel processor to accelerate rate tracing um but even then we were rate tracing at about you know frame every call it you know 10 frames maybe every second let's say maybe five frames every second depending on on how how many how many Rays we're talking about tracing and we were doing it at 1080 resolution uh obviously video games uh need a lot more than that obviously real-time Graphics need more than that this crowd definitely knows what that means but for the folks who are watching online who don't work in this field I mean this is basically a way of really manipulating light in computer Graphics simulating how a light interacts with versus through right happening in real time that's right the rendering processes used to take a really long time when you were making something it used to take a Cay supercomputer to render just a few pixels and now we have our RTX to accelerate that rate tracing but it was interactive it was real time but it wasn't fast enough to be uh a video game and so we realized that that we needed a big boost probably something along the lines of 20x or so maybe 50x or so boost and so uh the team uh invented dlss which basically renders one pixel while it uses AI to infer a whole bunch of other pixels and so we basically taught an AI that is conditioned on what it saw and then say fills in fills in the dots for everything else and now we're able to render fully Ray Trace fully path Trace simulation ations at 4K resolution at 300 frames per second made possible by by Ai and so 2018 came along uh 2022 as we all know chat GPT came out but the and what's that again chat GPT you know that yes open AI chat GPT a revolutionary revolutionary new uh new capability Ai and fastest growing service in history um but the two things that I wanted to highlight since since jgp the industry researchers um many of them in the room has figured out how to use AI to learn everything not just words but to learn the meaning of images and videos and 3D chemicals protein physics thermal dynamics fluid dynamics particle physics it's figured out the meaning of these uh all these different modalities and since then not only have we learned it we can now generate it and so you could that's the reason why you can go from text to images text to 3D images to text 3D to text text to video so on so forth text to proteins text to chemicals and so now generative AI has been uh made possible and this is really the Revolutionary time that we're in just about every industry is going to be affected by this just based on based on some of the examples I've already given you whether it's scientific Computing trying to do a better job uh predicting the weather with a lot less energy to uh augmenting and collaborating with with us uh creators to generate images or you know generating virtual scenes for industrial digitalization and very importantly robotics self-driving cars are all going to be transformed by generative Ai and so here we are in this brand new way of doing things and so let me just very quickly Lauren if you look at where we started in the upper left in 1964 uh the way that software was programmed human Engineers programming software now we have machines that are learning how to program the software de writing software that no humans can solving problems that we we could barely imagine before and now because we have generative AI a new way of developing software you know you you you I don't know if you know do you know Andre karpathy he's a really really terrific researcher I met him when he was at Stanford and and uh he coined the original way of doing software software 1.0 machine learning to be software 2.0 and now really we're moving toward software 3.0 because these generative AIS in the future instead of using machine learning to learn a new AI for every researcher you'll probably start with pre-trained models Foundation models that are already pre-trained and the way that we develop software could very very much be like assembling teams with Experts of various AI capabilities some that are using uh tools some that are able to generate you know special things and then a general purpose AI that's really good at reasoning that's connecting this this network of AIS together solving problems like team solve problems and so software 3.0 is here I've gotten the sense from talking to you recently that you are optimistic that this these generative AI tools will become more controllable more accurate we all know that there are issues with hallucinations uh low quality outputs that people are using these tools and they're maybe not getting exactly the output that they're hoping for right meanwhile they're using a lot of energy which we're going to talk about why are you so optimistic about this what is what do you think is pointing Us in the direction of this generative AI actually becoming that much more useful and controllable well uh the big breakthrough of Chad GPT uh was reinforcement learning human feedback which was uh the way of using humans to produce the right answers or the best answers to align the AI on our core values or align our AI on the skills that we would like it to perform that's probably the just the extraordinary breakthrough that made it possible for them to open chat GPT for everyone everyone to use other breakthroughs have have uh arrived since then Guard railing which uh which causes the AI to focus its energy or Focus its response in a particular domain so that uh it doesn't wander off and pontificate about all kinds of stuff that you ask it about it would only focus on the things that it's been trained to do align to perform and um uh that it it has deep knowledge in the third the third breakthrough is called uh retrieval augmented generation which basically is vectorized or data that has been uh embedded so that we understand the meaning of that data and so it's a more authoritative data set it goes beyond just the trained data set and it actually pulls from other sources that's right it's not just pre-ra data source it's and something you know for example uh it might be uh all of the articles that you've ever written all of the papers that you've ever written and so now it becomes uh something an AI That's authoritative on your uh and it could be essentially a uh a chatbot of you uh so everything that I've ever written or ever said could be vectorized and then created into a semantic database and then before an AI responds it would uh figure it would look at look at your prompt and it would uh it would uh search uh the appropriate content from that Vector database and then augment it um in its gener generative process and you think that that is one of the most important factors these three combinations really made it possible for us to do that with text now the thing that's really cool is that we are now starting to figure out how to do that with visuals right and you know sigraph is really about a lot about images and and generation and so if you look at today's generative AI uh you could give it a a prompt and it goes into uh in this particular case this is a uh edify uh AI model that Nvidia created it's a 2d text to 2D Foundation model it's multimodal and um uh we used uh we partnered with GTI to use uh their library of data uh to train uh an AI model and so this is a a text to uh 2D image and you also created this slide personally right I well I had I personally had the slide created and so imagine I'm the prompt and then there's a team that that's kind of like a generative Ai and then magically uh this slide shows up and so so here here's a prompt uh and this could be a prompt for somebody who owns a brand it could be a brand of um for in this case Coca-Cola it could be a car it could be a luxury product it could be anything and so uh you you use the prompt and generate the image however as you know it's hard to control this prompt and it may hallucinate uh it may um uh create it in such a way that it's not exactly what you want and to fine-tune this using words is really really hard because as you know words is very low dimensional ity it's extremely compressed in its content but it's it's very imprecise and so the ability for us to now control that image uh is difficult to do and so we've created a way that allows us to uh control and align that with more conditioning and so the way you do that is we create another model and this model for example allows us to text to 3D on the bottom it's called and it's edify 3D one of our foundation models we've created this AI Foundry where Partners can come and work with us and we create the model for them with their data we invent the model and they bring their data and we uh create a model that they can take with them is it their data only uses their data so this only uses all of the data that's available on Shutterstock uh that they have have the rights to to use the train and so we now use prompt generator 3D we put that in Omniverse Omniverse uh as you know is a is a place where you could compose uh data and content from a lot of different modalities it could be 3D it could be AI it could be animation it could be materials and so we use Omniverse to compose all of these multimodality uh data and now you can control it you could you could change the pose you could change the placement you could change whatever you like and then you use that image out of Omniverse to condition The Prompt okay so you take what comes out of Omniverse you now augment it with the prompt it's a little bit like augment retrieval augment a mented generation this is now 3D augmented generation Getty uh the edified model is multimodal so it understand the image understands the prompt and it uses it in combination to create a new image so now this is a controlled image and so this way we can use uh generative AI as a as a collaborator as a you know as a partner to to work with us um and uh uh we can generate images exactly the way we like it how does this translate to the physical world how does it translate to something like robotics well we're going to talk about robotics but one of the things that I would love to show you and I had this made not by myself well I had it made myself okay this is an Incredible video and this is a uh this is a work that is done by wpp uh Shutterstock uh working with uh some of the brand uh world class world famous brands that you'll you'll know let's run the video Let's show the build me a table in an empty room surrounded by chairs in a busy restaurant build me a table with tacos and bowls of salsa in the Morning Light build me a car on an empty road surrounded by trees buy a modern house build me a house with hills in the distance and bales of hay in the Evening Sun build me a tree in an empty field build me hundred of them in all Direction with bushes and Vines hanging in between building a giant brain forest with exotic flowers and rays of sunlight isn't that incredible and so so let so this is so this is this is what happened we taught we taught an AI how to speak USD open USD and so the young the the the girl is speaking to Omniverse Omniverse generates the USD and use USD search to then find the catalog of uh 3D objects that it has it composes the scene using words and and then um generative AI uh uses that augmentation to generate uh to condition the generation process and and so therefore uh the work that you do could be much much better controlled you could even collaborate with people because you can collaborate in Omniverse and you can collaborate in 3D it's hard to collaborate uh in 2D and so we can collaborate in 3D augment the generation process I imagine a lot of people in this room who aren't just technical but they're also storytellers this is a very technical room storytellers see something like this there's like 90% phds in here and think I'm not even going to ask you to do a raising of your hand but I'm sure that would be fascinating so they see something like this I see something like this and I think okay that's pretty amazing you are speeding up rendering times you're creating images out of nothing there are probably just as many people thinking what does this mean for my job where do you draw the line between this is augmenting and helping people where do you see the line being drawn and this is replacing certain things that humans do well that's what tools do uh we invent tools here this you know this conference is about inventing technology that ultimately ends up being a tool and that Tool uh either accelerates our work um uh collaborates with us so that we could do uh better work or even bigger work uh do work that's uh impossible before and so I think what you're going to what you you'll likely see is that generative AI uh is now going to be more controllable than before we've been able to do that with using uh Rags retrieval augmented generation to control uh text generation better reducing hallucination now we're using Omniverse with generative AI to control generative uh images better and reduce hallucination both of those tools uh help us be more productive and do things that we otherwise can't do and so I think I think um for all of the artists in the world I what I would say is is uh jump on this tool give it a try um imagine the stories that you're going to be able to tell uh with these tools and um uh and with respect to jobs uh I would say that it is very likely all of our jobs are going to be changed in what way well my job is going to change um the way in the future uh I'm going to be prompting a whole bunch of AIS uh everybody will have an AI that is an assistant and so every single company every single company every single job within the company will have AIS that are assistant to them our software programmers as you so you know now have AIS that help them program uh all all of our software Engineers have AIS that help them debug software uh we have AIS that help our chip designers design chips uh without without AI uh Hopper wouldn't have been possible without AI Blackwell wouldn't be possible you know today we're this week we're sampling we're sending out engineering samples of Blackwell all over the world they're under people's chairs right now I think if you just look if you get a GPU and you and I yeah you get a GPU you get a GPU yeah that's right supply chain we all we all we all wish yeah yeah and so so um I none none of the work that we do would be possible anymore without without generative Ai and uh that's increasingly the case with uh uh uh Our IT department helping our employees be more productive uh it's increasingly the case with our supply chain team optimizing Supply uh to be as efficient as possible um or our data center team using AI to manage the data center to save as much energy as possible you mentioned Omniverse before yeah uh that's not new but the idea that more generative AI would be within the Omniverse helping people create these simulations or digital twins yeah that's what we're announcing this week by the way Omniverse now Omniverse now uh understands uh text to USD um it could understand text to uh and has a semantic database so that it could do search of all the 3D objects um and uh that's how that that young lady was able to to say fill fill uh the scene with a whole bunch of trees uh describing how she would like the trees to be organized and somehow populates it with all these 3D trees then when that when that's done that 3D scene then goes into a generative AI uh uh model which turns turns it into a photorealistic model and if you want the the Ford truck to not be augmented but to use the the the actual brand um brand ground Truth uh then it would it would honor that and keep that uh keep that in the or in the final scene and so so I think if you if you if you do that uh so one of the things that that we talked about is how every single every single group in the company uh will have will have ai assistance and and um there's a lot of question lately about about um uh whether all this infrastructure that we're building is leading to productive work in companies I just gave you an example of how generative AI is impossible without without uh Nvidia nvidia's designs would be impossible without generative AI so we use it to transform the way we work but we also use it uh in many examples that I've just shown you in creating new products and new technology that either makes possible uh rate tracing in real time uh or Omniverse that we can now uh uh imagine and help us uh create much larger scenes um or uh our self-driving car work or our robotics work uh none of that none of that new capability would be possible without it and so one of the things that that we're announcing here uh this week is uh the concept of uh digital uh agents uh digital AIS uh that will augment every single job in the company and so uh one of the one of the the most important use cases that people are discovering is customer service and every single group every single company has customer service every single industry has customer service uh and in the future uh it's going today it's it's humans uh doing customer service but in the future my guess is that it's going to be human still but AI in the loop and the benefit of that is that you'll be able to uh uh retain uh the the um uh the experiences of all the customer service agents that you have and capture that institutional knowledge that you can then run into analytics that you can then uh use to create uh better services for your customers uh the the just now I showed you a a Omniverse augmented generation for images this is a rag this is a uh retrieval augmented generative Ai and the thing that we're doing is is uh We've created this customer service basically uh microservice that sits in the cloud and it's going to be available I think today or tomorrow and you can come and try it and we connected to it a digital human front end basically an IO uh the io of an AI that has the ability to uh speak make eye contact with you um an animate in an empathetic way um and uh uh you could decide to connect your chat chat gbt or your AI I to the digital human or you can connect um uh your digital human to our uh retrieval augmented generation uh customer service AI uh so however you like to do it we're a platform company so irrespective of which piece you would like to use uh they're completely open source and you can come and use the pieces that you like uh if you would like the incredible digital human rendering technology that we've created for uh rendering beautiful faces uh which requires subsurface scattering with path tracing this breakthrough uh is really quite incredible and it makes it possible for us amazing Graphics researchers welcome to sigraph 2024 so it makes it possible to animate uh using an AI so uh you you chat with the AI it generates text that text then is translated uh to sound text to speech that speech the sound then animates the face and and then RTX path tracing um does the does the rendering of the digital human and so all of this is available for developers to use and you could you could decide which parts you would like to use how are you thinking about the ethics of something like this you're unleashing this to developers to Graphics artists but these are being Unleashed into the world y do you think a chatbot like that a a very human like visual chatbot should say that it's a chatbot what is it so human that people start mistaking it for humans they're emotionally vulnerable it's it's still it's still pretty it's still pretty robotic and I think that that's not a terrible thing you know we're going to stay we're going to be robotic for for some time I think it we've made we've made uh this digital human technology uh quite realistic but you and I know it's still a it's still a robot and so I I think um uh that's not a that's not a a horrible way um it is the case that there are many many different applications where the human engagement is much uh much more engaging uh having a human representation or near human representation than a text box uh maybe somebody needs companion or Healthcare needs to advise um somebody who is an outpatient uh who had just gone home uh you know helping elderlies um you know there's a whole bunch of applications uh a tutor which to educate a child um all these different applications are better off having somebody who is much more human and being able to connect with uh with the audience that's interesting yeah what I hear you talking a lot about today these are software developments right they're relying on your gpus But ultimately this is software this is NVIDIA going further up the stack meanwhile there are some companies some folks in the generative AI space who are in software and Cloud services but they're looking to go further down the stack right they might be developing their own chips or tpus that are competitive with what you are doing how crucial is this software strategy to Nvidia maintaining its lead and actually fulfilling some of these promises of growth that people are looking at for NVIDIA right now well um we've always been a software company um and even first and the reason for that is because accelerated Computing is not general purpose Computing general purpose Computing can take any c program or C Supply program Python and just run it and almost everybody's uh program can be compiled to run effectively unfortunately when you want to accelerate fluid dynamics you have to understand the the algorithms of fluid dynamics so that you could uh refactor it in such way that it could be accelerated and you have to design an accelerator you have to design the cou at GPU so that it understands the algorithms so that it could do a good job accelerating it and the benefit of course is that we can by doing so by redesigning the whole stack we can accelerate applications 20 40 50 times 100 times for example uh we just put um Nvidia gpus in in uh gcp uh running pandas uh which is the world's leading uh data science platform and we accelerated from 50 to 100x over general purpose Computing uh in the case of deep learning over the course of last 10 to 12 years or so uh We've accelerated deep learning by a million times which is the reason why it's now possible for us to create these large language models a million times speed up a million times reduction in cost and energy is what made it possible for us to make General generative AI possible but that's not that's that's by designing a new processor a new system tensor core gpus the mvlink switch fabric uh is completely groundbreaking for AI of course the systems itself the algorithms the distributed computing uh uh uh Library we call Megatron that everybody uses um tensor rtlm those are algorithms and if you don't understand the algorithms the the applications above it it's really hard to figure out how to design that whole stack what is the most important part of Nvidia software ecosystem for nvidia's future well every single one of it takes a new library we call it dsl's domain specific Library um in in uh in generative AI that DSL is called qnn uh for SQL processing uh data frames is called qdf and so if you go SQL pandas uh CDF is what makes it possible for us to accelerate that for Quantum emulation it's called K Quantum uh uh C fft we got a whole bunch of coups uh computational lithography which makes it makes it possible for us to uh help the industry Advance the next generation of processed technology called K litho um you know the the number of coups it goes on and on every time we introduce a domain specific Library it exposes accelerated Computing to a new market and so as you see it takes that collaboration the the the the the um uh the full stack of the library and the architecture and the go to market and developers and the ecosystems around it to open up a new field and so it's not just about building the accelerator you have to build a whole stack nvidia's dependent on a lot of things going right your your foray into the future your Innovation depends on a lot of things going right you have to continue pushing the laws of physics you do have competitors who are nipping at your heels at all times we've talked about this what keeps you up at night uh you're also somewhat relling on the geopolitical stability last night just so you know elevation drink some water that's what they told me but it was it was too late by the time I learned about it this morning I I woke up with a a terrible headache elevation that's what was last night okay so elevation uh but truly you have to keep pushing the laws of physics you have competitors who are nipping at your heels both on the software and Hardware side you are somewhere Aliant on the geopolitical stability of the South China Sea uh geopolitics uh so much going on right now you're reminding me it's it's it's super hard building a company it is you but you've had a lot of you're making me nervous I was fine before there's so many things that he wants to go back to showing you slides uh but truly you've and you've had you've had a lot of Tailwinds and I'm just you know how optimistic are you that these the things are going to keep trending in your direction things have never trended in our Direction uh you have to will the future into existence accelerated Computing you know the world wants general purpose computing and the reason for that is because it's easy you just you just have the software it just runs twice as fast every single year don't even think about it and you know every five years is 10 times faster every 10 years is 100 times faster what's not to love but of course you can shrink a transistor but you can't shrink an atom and eventually uh the CPU architecture uh ran its course and so we it's not sensible anymore uh as the technology doesn't give us those leaps that a general purpose instrument could be good at everything you know could be good at these incredible things from Deep learning to Quantum simulation to molecular Dynamics the fluid dynamics right so on the computer graphics and so we created this accelerated Computing architecture to do that um but that that that fights that fight that's headwind do you see what I'm saying because general purpose Computing is the easy way to do it we've been doing it for 60 years why not keep doing it and so so accelerated Computing was only possible because we we deliver such extreme extraordinary speedups at a time when energy is becoming more scarce um at a time when when um uh we no longer could just ride the CPU curve any longer dard scaling is has has really uh ended and um I and so we need another approach and and that's why that's why we're here but notice every single time we want to open up a new market like qdf in order to do data processing data processing is probably what a third of the world data a third of the world's Computing every company does data processing and most companies data is in data frames you know in tabular format and so in order to create an acceleration library for tabular formats was insanely hard because what's inside those tables could be floating Point numbers 64-bit integers it could be you know numbers and letters and all kinds of stuff and so we have to figure out a way to go compute all that and so so you see that almost every single time we want to grow into something you have to go and learn it that's the reason why we're working on robotics that's the reason why we're working on autonomous vehicles to understand the algorithms that's necessary to open up that market and to understand the Computing layer underneath it so that we can deliver extraordinary results and so as you could see each each time we open up a new market um healthare digital biology the work with the amazing work we're doing there with biion Nemo and uh uh parab bricks for Gene sequencing every single time we open up a new market it just requires us to reinvent everything of that Computing and so there's nothing easy about it generative AI takes up a lot of energy I'm just saying my job's super hard but your assistance you're your AI assistants are going to make it easier right what's that somebody's got to Pat my back hey little Applause you guys Cher on yeah go ahead uh let's talk about energy yeah generative AI incredibly energy intensive y uh I am going to read from my note cards here uh According to some research chat gbt a single query takes up nearly 10 times the electricity to process a single Google search uh data centers consume 1 to 2% of overall worldwide energy but some say that it could be as much as 3 to 4% some say as much as 6% by the end of the decade uh data center workloads tripled between 25 uh 2015 and 2019 that was only 2019 um AI generative AI is taking up a large portion of all of that is there going to be enough energy to fulfill the demand of what you want to build and do yeah um yes and um a couple of observations so first there there are two or three um or or three or four uh model makers that are pushing to Frontier a couple of years ago uh they're they're probably three times that many this year but it's still it's still single digit you know it's very high single digit but call a 10 that are pushing the frontiers of um of models and the size of the models are uh call it uh twice as large every year maybe maybe uh faster than that and in order to train a model that's twice as large you need you know more than twice as much data and so the computational load is growing um probably uh by you know call it a factor of four each year just for simple simple simple thinking now that's one of the reasons why Blackwell uh is is uh so highly anticipated because we accelerated the application uh so much using the same amount of energy and so this is an example of accelerating applications uh uh at constant energy constant cost you're making it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper now the important thing though is I've only highlighted 10 companies the world has tons of companies and their data centers everywhere and Nvidia is selling gpus to a whole lot of companies and a whole lot of different data centers and so question is what's happening at the core the first thing that's actually happening is the end of CPU scaling and the beginning of accelerated Computing data processing um uh just text completion speech recognition all of those kind of basic AI things that are that are used um recommender systems uh that are used in in data centers all over the world they are moving everyone is moving from CPUs to accelerated Computing because uh they want to save energy accelerated Computing helps you save so much energy 20 times 50 times in doing the same processing so the first thing that we have to do you know as a society is accelerate every application we can can if you're doing spark data processing ex run it with accelerated spark so that you could reduce the amount of energy necessary by 20 times if you're doing SQL processing do SQL um accelerated SQL so that you could reduce the power by 20 times and so uh uh if you're doing weather simulation accelerate it when you're doing uh whatever scientific simulation you're doing accelerated uh image processing accelerated a lot of those applications used to be uh running on CPUs and general purpose Computing all of that should be accelerated going forward that's the first thing that's happening now it is that reducing the amount of energy being used all over the world absolutely the density of our gpus and density of accelerated Computing is higher energy density is higher but the amount of energy used is dramatically lower so that's the first thing that's happening of course then generative AI generative AI is probably consuming let's pick a very large number probably you know 1% or so of the world's energy but remember even if the data centers uh consume 4% of the world the goal of generative AI is not training the goal of generative AI is inference and the inference ideally we create new models for predicting weather uh predicting new materials allow us to uh um uh optimize uh our supply chain reduce the amount of energy consumed and wasted gasoline uh as we deliver products and so the goal is actually to reduce the energy consumed of the 96% and so uh very importantly you have to think about gener about AI from a longitudinal perspective not just going to school but what happens after going to school you and I both went to Stanford Stanford's not inexpensive um I think you studied something slightly different though yeah yeah sure it's a big school it's worked out well for it's worked out well for both of us and so and so so the goal of course is is is going to school is important uh but of course the important thing is is really after school and all of the contributions that we're made we're able to make the society and so generative AI is going to increase productivity it's going to Ena enable us to discover new science make things more energy efficient um don't let me don't let me finish without without showing you uh the next and so so that the lights just came on because why we were talking about energy and all of a sudden it's like the Earth was like okay Tamp down the energy usage folks I thought I thought they were G am I getting Chang we still have a few minutes so I mean I hope so I mean I'm not I'm not going to get off the stage until Mark comes on here and kicks me off how about that he's not going to do that he's a great guy so anyways uh think think think about generative AI um longitudinally and all the impact of of generative AI the second thing the next thing I'll say about generative AI is remember in the the traditional way doing Computing is called retrieval based Computing everything is pre-recorded all the stories are written pre-recorded all the images are pre-recorded all the videos are pre-recorded and so and so everything is stored off in a data center somewhere pre-recorded generative AI reduces the amount of energy necessary to go run to a data center over the network re retrieve something and bring it over the network don't forget the data center is not the only place that consumes energy the world's Data Center only rep that is only 40% of the total Computing done 60% of the energy is consumed on the internet moving the electrons around moving the bits and bites around and so generative AI is going to reduce the amount of energy on the internet because instead of having to go retrieve the information we can generate it right there on the spot because we understand the context we probably have some uh content already on the device and we can generate the response so that you don't have to go retrieve it uh somewhere else well part of that is also moving atoms around right one last thing I got to tell you laen one last thing I remember AI doesn't care where it goes to school today's data centers are are built near the power grid where Society is of course because that's where we need it in the future you're going to see data centers being built in different parts of the world where there's excess energy it's just that it costs a lot of money to bring that energy to society maybe it's in a desert maybe it's uh in places that has a lot of sustainable energy but it's not a lot of water well uh there's plenty of water as well it just happens to be undrinkable water and so uh we can use we can use water that are uh we we can we can put data centers where there's less population and um more energy okay just don't don't forget that there's there's plenty there's a lot of energy coming from the Sun there's a lot of energy in the world and what we need to do is move data centers out closer to where there's excess energy and not put everything near population well part AI doesn't care where it's trained part I'd never heard that phrase before AI doesn't care where it goes to school and that's interesting yeah it's true I'm going to think on that yeah uh part of part of calculating the carbon emissions though is also considering the supply chain it's also considering it's going all down the line uh and it requires transparency don't don't move don't move the energy to the data center use the energy where the data center is and then when you're done uh you have a highly compressed model that is essentially the compression of all the energy that was used and we can take that model and bring it back hey can we talk about the next wave so the first wave of course the first wave is accelerated Computing I think I know that she's the interviewer and we're on we're we're we're doing this on her terms but I'm the CEO so so and and and so so no Lauren we we need to come and tell tell this this group about the work that we're doing that that that uh is is really really Court to I I have so many good questions for you I know I know I want to ask you about open source which I think you're going to be talking to Mark about I I want to ask you about I have it import by the way open source is really important it's incredible yeah if not if if not for open source if not for open source uh how would all of these industries and all these companies be able to engage Ai and so look at look at all the companies and all the different Industries they're all using llama llama 2 today today llama 3.1 just came out uh people are so excited about it uh We've we've made it possible to democratize Ai and engage every single industry in AI but the thing that I want to say is this the first wave is accelerated Computing reduces energy consumed allows us to deliver continued computational demand without all of the Power continued to grow with it so number one accelerate everything it made it possible for us to have generative AI the generative AI the first wave of it of of course is all the pioneers and we you know we know many of the Pioneers open AI anthropic uh Google uh Microsoft a whole bunch of amazing companies doing this uh uh X is doing this x. is doing this amazing companies doing this the next the next wave of AI we we didn't talk about which is uh Enterprise of course one of its applications is customer service and we hope that we can uh give every single organization the ability to create their own AIS and so everybody would be augmented and and have a collaborative AI that could um uh Empower them help them do better work the next wave of AI after that is called physical Ai and this is this is really really quite extraordinary this is where we're going to need three computers one computer to uh create the AI another computer toes simulate the AI both using synthetic gen for synthetic data generation as well as a place where the AI robot the humano robot or the the manipulation robot could go learn how to uh refine its Ai and then of course the third AI is the computer that actually runs the AI so it's a threea three computer problem you know it's a three body problem and so it's incredibly comp it's incredibly complicated and we created three computers to do that and we made a video uh for you for you to enjoy uh understanding this the thing that that we've done here is this uh in every each one of these computers depending on whether you want to use the software stack the algorithms on top or just the Computing infrastructure just a processor for the robot or the functional safety operating system that runs on top of it or the AI and computer vision models that run on top of that or uh just the computer itself any piece is any layer of that stack is open uh for robotics uh developers we created a quick video let's take a look at that is that okay that sounds great the era of physical AI is here physical AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world will embody robots many will be humanoid robots developing these Advanced robots is complex requiring vast amounts of data and workload orchestration across diverse Computing infrastructures Nvidia is working to simplify and accelerate developer workflows with three Computing platforms Nvidia AI Omniverse and Jetson Thor plus generative AI enabled developer tools to accelerate project Groot a general humanoid robot Foundation model Nvidia researchers capture human demonstrations seeing the robot's hands in spatial overlay over the physical world they then use robokos a generative simulation framework integrated into Nvidia Isaac lab to produce a massive number of environments and layouts they increase their data size using mimic gen M which helps them generate large scale synthetic motion data sets based on the small number of original captures they train the Groot model on Nvidia dgx cloud with the combined real and synthetic data sets next they perform software in the loop testing in Isaac Sim and the cloud and Hardware in the loop validation on Jetson Thor before deploying the improved model to the real robots Nvidia osmo robotics Cloud compute orchestration service manages job assignment and scaling across distributed resources throughout the workflow together these Computing platforms are empowering developers worldwide to bring us into the age of physical AI powered humanoid robot you know you know what's amazing Lauren at this conference sigraph is where all of this technology comes together isn't that right everybody researchers of sigraph isn't that right so whether it's computer Graphics or simulation artificial intelligence robotics all of it comes right comes together right here at sigra and that's the reason why I think you should come to sigra from now on me yes I'm happy to I'm thrilled to you I I I took I took uh uh I want 100% of the world's Tech press should come to Cigar we can get behind that just drink a lot of water um uh I went and saw some of the art exhibits last night upstairs in the exhibition effort fantastic just really really cool loved the literal spam Bots whoever created that one go check it out um I was actually listening to the sigraph spotlight podcast before this if folks haven't listened I I really recommend it uh the special projects chair was interviewing a couple of Graphics Legends including David yam yeah and one of the things that David M talked about was archives and this is kind of an existential question for this crowd right but people are creating this really amazing digital media all these these computer Graphics you are accelerating it with your technology it changes so fast now how do you ensure that everything folks are building lives into the future file formats archives accessing all of this work in the future the robots will live on y I have no concern they're going to take over y right Y what about what about the art that people are creating this is this is the existential question but all this well one of the one of the one of the uh that's an excellent question and one of the one of the um the formats that we deeply believe in is open USD open USD is the first format that brings together multimodality from almost almost every single tool and allows it uh to interact to be composed together uh to uh go in and out of these Virtual Worlds and so you could bring in just about any format ideally over time into it uh at this conference we announced that URF the universal robotics data format is now compatible with or can be ingested into into um uh open USD and so one one format after another format uh we're going to bring uh everything into this one common one common language using standards is one of the best ways uh to uh allow content and data to uh be shared be allow everybody to collaborate on it and to lift forever for example HTML without HTML uh it would have been hard for all of these different content from around the world to be accessible to everybody and so in a lot of ways open USD is the HTML of Virtual Worlds and um uh we we've we've been a early promoter of it um uh there's uh amazing companies that have joined and many other companies joining and um my expectation is every single design tool in the world will be able to connect to open USD and once you connect to that virtual world uh you can collaborate with uh anybody with any other Tool uh anywhere and so just like we with HTML you said this content can live forever are you going to build a gensen AI that lives forever absolutely there's a gensen AI in fact just about everything that I've ever said everything that I've ever written and ever done uh will likely be ingested into one of these uh uh generative AI models and I'm I'm I'm hoping that that happens and then uh in the future you'll be able to prompt it and and hopefully something smart gets said so jent and the might to be uh running your earnings calls in the future I hope so that's that's the first thing that has to go that's the first thing it has to go to a bot Jensen thank you so much I think we're probably going to get kicked off stage soon but you'll be back shortly with Mark Zuckerberg and welcome to your first cig ladies and gentlemen Lauren good thank you thank you it's really great shatting again thank you everybody we'll be right back Video games have spectacular graphics, capable of transporting you to incredibly detailed cities, heart-racing battlegrounds, magical worlds, and breathtaking environments. While this may look like an old western train station and locomotive from Red Dead Redemption 2, it’s actually composed of 2.1 million vertices assembled into 3.5 million triangles with 976 colors and textures assigned to the various surfaces, all with a virtual sun illuminating the scene below.But perhaps the most impressive fact is that these vertices, textures, and lights are entirely composed of ones and zeroes that’s continuously being processed inside your computer’s graphics card or a video game console. So then, how does your computer take billions of ones and zeroes and turn it into realistic 3D graphics? Well, let’s jump right in.The video game graphics rendering pipeline has three key steps: Vertex Shading, Rasterization, and Fragment Shading. While additional steps are used in many modern video games, these three core steps have been used for decades in thousands of video games for both computers and consoles and are still the backbone of the video game graphics algorithm for pretty much every game you play.Let’s begin with the first step called vertex shading. The basic idea in this step is to take all the objects’ geometries and meshes in a 3D space and use the field of view of the camera to calculate where each object falls in a 2D window called the view screen, which is the 2D image that’s sent to the display. In this train station scene, there are 1,100 different models and the camera’s field of view sections off what the player sees, reducing the number of objects that need to be rendered to 600. Let’s focus on the locomotive as an example.Although this engine has rounded surfaces and some rather complex shapes, it’s actually assembled from 762 thousand flat triangles using 382 thousand vertices and 9 different materials or colors applied to the surfaces of the triangles. Conceptually, the entire train is moved as one piece onto the viewscreen, but actually, each of the train’s hundreds of thousands of vertices are moved one at a time. So, let’s focus on a single vertex. The process of moving a vertex, and by extension, the triangles and the train, from a 3D world onto a 2D view screen is done using 3 transformations. First moving a vertex from model space to world space, then from world space to camera space, and finally from the perspective field of view onto the view screen. To perform this transformation we use the X,Y, and Z coordinates of that vertex in modeling space, then the position, scale, and rotation of the model in world space, and finally the coordinates and rotation of the camera and its field of view. We plug all these numbers into different transformation matrices and multiply them together resulting in the X and Y values of the vertex on the view screen as well as a Z value or depth, which we’ll use later to determine object blocking. After three vertices of the train are transformed using similar matrix math, we get a single triangle moved onto the view screen. Then the rest of the 382 thousand vertices of the train and the 2.1 million vertices of all the 600 objects in the camera’s field of view undergo a similar set of transformations, thereby moving all 3.5 million triangles onto a 2D viewscreen. This is an incredible amount of matrix math, but GPUs in graphics cards and video game consoles are designed to be triangle mesh rendering monsters and thus have evolved over decades to handle millions of triangles every few milliseconds. For example, this GPU has 10,000ish cores designed to efficiently execute up to 35 trillion operations of 32-bit multiplication and addition every second, and, by distributing the vertex co-ordinates and transformation data among each of the cores, the GPU can easily render the scene resulting in 120 or more frames a second. Now that we have all the vertices moved onto a 2D plane, the next step is to use the 3 vertices of a single triangle and figure out which specific pixels on your display are covered by that triangle. This process is called rasterization.A 4K monitor or TV has a resolution of thirty-eight forty by twenty-one sixty, yielding around 8.3 million pixels. Using the X and Y coordinates of the vertices of a given triangle on the view screen, your GPU calculates where it falls within this massive grid and which of the pixels are covered by that particular triangle. Next, those pixels are shaded using the texture or color assigned to that triangle. Thus, with rasterization, we turn triangles into fragments which are groups of pixels that come from the same triangle and share the same texture or color. Then we move on to the next triangle and shade in the pixels that are covered by it and continue to do this for each of the 3.5 million triangles that were previously moved onto the viewscreen. By applying the Red Blue and Green color values of each triangle to the appropriate pixels, a 4K image is formed in the frame buffer and sent to the display. You’re probably wondering how we account for triangles that overlap or block other triangles. For example, the train is blocking the view of much of the train station. Additionally, the train has hundreds of thousands of triangles on its backside that are sent through the rendering pipeline, but obviously don’t appear in the final image. Determining which triangles are in front is called the visibility problem and is solved by using a Z-buffer or Depth Buffer. A Z-Buffer adds an extra value to each of the 8.3 million pixels corresponding to the distance or depth that each pixel is from the camera.In the previous step, when we did the vertex transformations, we ended up with X and Y coordinates, but then also got a Z value that corresponds to the distance from the transformed vertex to the camera. When a triangle is rasterized, it covers a set of pixels and the Z value or depth of the triangle is compared with the values stored in the Z-Buffer. If the triangle’s depth values are lower than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is closer to the camera, then we paint in those pixels using the triangle’s color and re-place the Z-buffer’s values using that triangle’s Z-values. However, let’s say a second triangle comes along with Z values that are higher than those in the Z-buffer, meaning the triangle is further away. We just throw it out and keep the pixels from the triangle that was previously painted with lower Z-values. Using this method, only the closest triangles to the camera with the lowest Z-values will be displayed on the screen. By the way, here’s the image of the Z or Depth buffer, wherein black is close and white is far. Note that because these triangles are in 3D space, the vertices often have 3 different Z values, and thus each individual pixel of the triangle needs its Z value computed using the vertex coordinates. This allows intersecting triangles to properly render out their intersections pixel by pixel. One issue with rasterization and these pixels is that if the triangle cuts at an angle and passes through the center of the pixel, then the entire pixel is painted with that triangle’s color resulting in jagged and pixelated edges.To reduce the appearance of these jagged edges, graphics processors implement a technique called Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing. With SSAA, 16 sampling points are distributed across a single pixel, and when a triangle cuts through a pixel, depending on how many of the 16 sampling points the triangle covers, a corresponding fractional shade of that color is applied to the pixel, resulting in faded edges in the image and significantly less noticeable pixelization.One thing to remember is that when you’re playing a video game, your character’s camera view as well as the objects in the scene are continuously moving around. As a result, the process and calculations within vertex shading, rasterization, and fragment shading are recalculated for every single frame once every 8.3 milliseconds for a game running at 120 frames a second.Let’s move onto the next step which is Fragment Shading. Now that we have a set of pixels corresponding to each triangle, it’s not enough to simply paint by number to color the pixels. Rather, to make the scene realistic, we have to account for the direction and strength of the light or illumination, the position of the camera, reflections, and shadows cast by other objects. Fragment shading is therefore used to shade in each pixel with accurate illumination to make the scene realistic. As a reminder, fragments are groups of pixels formed from a single rasterized triangle. Let’s see the fragment shader in action. This train engine is mostly made of black metal, and if we apply the same color to each of its pixel fragments, we get a horribly inaccurate train. But once we apply proper shading, such as making the bottom darker and the top lighter, and by adding in specular highlights or shininess where the light bounces off the surface, we get a realistic black metal train. Additionally, as the sun moves in the sky, the shading on the train reflects the passage of time throughout the day, and, if it’s night, the materials and colors of all the objects are darker and illuminated from the light of the fire. Even video games such as Super Mario 64 which is almost 30 years old have some simple shading where the colors of surfaces are changed by the lighting and shadows in the scene. So, let’s see how fragment shading works. The basic idea is that if a surface is pointing directly at a light source such as the sun, it’s shaded brighter whereas if a surface is facing perpendicular to, or away from the light, it’s shaded darker.In order to calculate a triangle’s shading, there are two key details we need to know. First, the direction of the light and second, the direction the triangle’s surface is facing. Let’s continue to use the locomotive as an example and paint it bright red instead of black. As you already know, this train is made of 762 thou-sand flat triangles, many of which face in different directions. The direction that an individual triangle is facing is called its surface normal, which is simply the direction perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, kind of like a flagpole sticking out of the ground. To calculate a triangle’s shading, we take the cosine of the angle or theta between the two directions. The cosine theta value is 1 when the surface is facing the light and when the surface is perpendicular to the light it’s 0. Next, we multiply cosine theta by the intensity of the light and then by the color of the material to get the properly shaded color of that triangle. This process adjusts the triangles’ RGB values and as a result, we get a range of lightness to darkness of a surface depending on how its individual triangles are facing the light. However, if the surface is perpendicular or facing away, we don’t want a cosine theta value of 0 or a negative number because this would result in a pitch-black surface. Therefore, we set the minimum to 0 and add in an ambient light intensity times the surface color, and adjust this ambient light so that it’s higher in daytime scenes, and closer to 0 at night. Finally, when there are multiple light sources in a scene, we perform this calculation multiple times with different light directions, and intensities and then add the individual contributions together. Having more than a few light sources is computationally intense for your GPU, and thus scenes limit the number of individual light sources and sometimes limit the range of influence for the lights so that triangles will ignore distant lights. The vector and matrix math used in rendering video game graphics is rather complicated, but luckily there’s a free and easy way to learn it and that’s with Brilliant.org. Brilliant is a multidisciplinary online interactive education platform and is the best way to learn math, computer science, and many other fields of science and engineering. Thus far we’ve been simplifying the math behind video game graphics considerably. For example, vectors are used to find the value of cosine theta between the direction of the light and the surface normal, and the GPU uses the dot product divided by the norm of the two vectors to calculate it. Additionally, we skipped a lot of detail when it came to 3D shapes and transformations from one coordinate system to another using matrices. Rather fittingly, Brilliant.org has entire courses on vector calculus, trigonometry, and 3D geometry, as well as courses on linear algebra and matrix math. All of which have direct applications to this video and are needed for you to fully understand graphics algorithms.Alternatively, if you’re all set with math, we recommend their course on Thinking in Code which will help you build a solid foundation on computational problem solving.Brilliant is offering a free 30-day trial with full access to their thousands of lessons.

The link is in the description below.Let’s get back to exploring fragment shading. One key problem with it is that the triangles within an object each have only a single normal, and thus each triangle will share the same color throughout the triangle’s surface. This is called flat shading and is rather unrealistic when viewed on curved surfaces such as the body of this steam engine.So, in order to produce smooth shading, instead of using surface normals, we use one normal for each vertex calculated using the average of the normals of the adjacent triangles. Next, we use a method called barycentric coordinates to produce a smooth gradient of normals across the surface of a triangle. Visually it’s like mixing 3 different colors across a triangle, but instead we’re using the three vertex normal directions. For a given fragment we take the center of each pixel and use the vertex normals and coordinates of the pre-rasterized triangle to calculate the barycentric normal of that particular pixel. Just like mixing the three colors across a triangle this pixel’s normal will be a proportional mix of the three vertex normals of the triangle. As a result, when a set of triangles is used to form a curved surface, each pixel will be part of a gradient of normals resulting in a gradient of angles facing the light with pixel-by-pixel coloring and smooth shad-ing across the surface. We want to say that this has been one of the most enjoyable videos to make simply because we love playing video games and seeing the algorithm that makes these incredible graphics has been a joy. We spent over 540 hours researching, writing, modelling this scene from RDR2, and animating.

Thus far we’ve covered the core steps for the graphics rendering pipeline, however, there are many more steps and advanced topics. For example, you might be wondering where ray tracing and DLSS or deep learning super sampling fits into this pipeline. Ray tracing is predominately used to create highly detailed scenes with accurate lighting and reflections typically found in TV and movies and a single frame can take dozens of minutes or more to render. For video games, the primary visibility and shading of the objects are calculated using the graphics rendering pipeline we discussed, but in certain video games ray tracing is used to calculate shadows, reflections, and improved lighting. On the other hand, DLSS is an algorithm for taking a low resolution frame and upscaling it to a 4K frame using a convolution neural network. Therefore DLSS is executed after ray tracing and the graphics pipeline generates a low-resolution frame. One interesting note is that the latest generation of GPUs has 3 entirely separate architectures of computational resources or cores. CUDA or Shading cores execute the graphics rendering pipeline. Ray tracing cores are self-explanatory. And then DLSS is run on the Tensor cores. Therefore, when you’re playing a high-end video game with Ray Tracing and DLSS, your GPU utilizes all of its computational resources at the same time, allowing you to play 4K games and render frames in less than 10 milliseconds each. Whereas if you were to solely rely on the CUDA or shading cores, then a single frame would take around 50 milliseconds. With that in mind, Ray Tracing and DLSS are entirely different topics with their own equally complicated algorithms, and therefore we’re planning separate videos that will explore each of these topics in detail. Furthermore, when it comes to video game graphics, there are advanced topics such as Shadows, Reflections, UVs, Normal Maps and more. Therefore, we’re considering making an additional video on these advanced topics. If you’re interested in such a video let us know in the comments.

Thanks for watching to the end! ladies and gentlemen I have a very special guest but could I ask everybody to sit down we're about to get started my next my next guest I am so impressed by this person three reasons first reason is there are only a handful of entrepreneurs Founders that started a company that literally touched the lives of billions of people around the world as part of the social fabric invented services and a state-of-the-art Computing company two very few entrepreneurs Founders founded the company and led it to over a trillion dollars of value and three a College Dropout all three things simultaneously ladies and Gentlemen please help me welcome Mark Zuckerberg welcome Mark welcome to your first sigraph right can you believe this one of the pioneers of computing a driver of modern Computing and I had to invite him to sigraph so anyways marks it down it's great to have you here welcome thanks for flying down yeah know this will be fun I he been going for like five hours already or something well yeah sure this is sigraph you know this 90% phds And so so the thing that's really great about sigraph uh as you know this is this is the show of computer Graphics image processing artificial intelligence and Robotics combined and some of the some of the companies that over the years have demonstrated and revealed amazing things here from Disney Pixar Adobe epic games and of course you know Nvidia we've done a lot of work here this year uh we introduced 20 papers at the intersection of artificial intelligence and simulation so we're using artificial intelligence to do um help simulation uh be way larger scale way faster for example uh differentiable physics uh we're using simulation to create uh simulation environments for synthetic data generation for artificial intelligence and so these two areas is are really coming together um really proud of the work that we've done here at meta uh you guys have done amazing AI work I mean one of the things that that that I find amusing is is uh uh when the Press writes about how metas jumped into AI this last last couple of years um as if uh you know the the work that that fair has done uh remember we all use pytorch that comes out of meta uh the uh the work that you do in computer vision the work in uh language models real-time translation uh groundbreaking work I guess my first question for you is you know how do you see how do you see the uh uh the advances of generative AI ad meta today and how do you apply it to either enhance your operations or introduce new capabilities that you're offering yeah so oh a lot to unpack there first of all really happy to be here um you know meta has done a lot of work and has has been at sigra for you know eight years so I mean it's a you know we're noobs compared to to you guys but um you I think it was back in in 2018 you're dressed right but this is my hood I just want it's I mean well thank you for welcoming me to your hood um I think it was back in 2018 we we we showed the some of the early hand tracking work on um for our VR and mixed reality headsets um and I think we've talked a bunch about the progress that we're making on codec avatars the photorealistic um avatars that we want to be able to drive from consumer headsets which we're getting closer and closer to so pretty excited about that and also a lot of the display systems work that we've done so um some of the future prototypes and research for getting the mixed reality headsets to be able to be really thin with like with just um pretty Advanced Optical stacks and and display uh systems the the integrated system I that's that's been stuff that we've typically uh shown here first so um excited to be here uh you know this year not just talking about the metaverse stuff but but also um all the AI pieces which as you said I me we started Fair uh the the AI Research Center um at you know back then it was Facebook now meta uh before we started reality Labs I we've been at this for for a while um the you know all the stuff around gen it's it's an interesting Revolution and and and I think that it's going to it's going to end up making I think all of the different products that we do you know different and and in in interesting ways I mean I I kind of go through you can look at the big product lines that we have already so things like the you know feed and recommendation systems and Instagram and Facebook and we've kind of been on this journey where that's gone from just being about connecting with your friends and the ranking was always important because you even when you were just um you know following friends you know if someone did something really important like your cousin had a baby or something it's like you want that at the top you'd be pretty angry at us if we that was buried somewhere down in your feed um so the ranking was was important but now over the last few years it's gotten to a point where more of that stuff is um is just different public content that's out there the recommendation systems are super important because now instead of just a few hundred or thousand potential candidate posts from friends um there's millions of of of pieces of content and that turns into like a really interesting recommendation problem and with generative AI um I think we're going to quickly move into this Zone where not only is is the majority of the content that you see today on Instagram you know just recommended to you from kind of stuff that's out there in the world that matches your interests whether not you follow the people I think in the future a lot of the stuff is going to be created with these tools too some of that is going to be creators using the tools to create new content some of it I think eventually is going to be content that's either created on the Fly for you um or or or kind of pulled together and synthesize through different things that are out there so that that's just one example of how kind of the core part of what we're doing is just going to evolve and it's been evolving for for 20 years already but I think few people realize that that uh one of the largest Computing systems the world has ever conceived of a recommenders system yeah I mean it's this whole yeah it's this whole different path right it's it's not quite the kind of Genai hotness that people talk about but I think it's it's like as I mean it's all the Transformer architectures and it's a similar thing of just building up more more General models embeding embedding unstructured data into features and yeah I mean one of the big things that just drives quality improvements is you know it used to be that you'd have a different model for each type of content right so a recent example is you know we had you know one model for ranking and recommending reals and another model for ranking and recommending more long form videos and then you know take some product work to basically make it so that the system can display you know anything in line but you know the more you kind of just create more General recommendation models that can span everything it just gets better and better so I mean part of it I think is just like economics and liquidity of content and the broader of a pool that you can pull from you're you're just not having these weird inefficiencies of pulling from different pools but yeah mean as the models get bigger and more General that gets better and better so I I kind of dream of one day like you can almost imagine all of Facebook or Instagram being you know like a single AI model that has unified all these different content types and systems together that actually have different objectives over different time frames right because some of it is just showing you you know what's the interesting content that you're going to be that that you want to see today but some of it is helping you build out your network over the long term right people you may know accounts you might want to follow and these these multimodal models tend to be yeah tend to be much better at recognizing patterns weak signals and such and so one of the things that people people always you know it's so interesting that AI has been so deep in your company you've been building GPU infrastructure running these large recommender systems for a long time now you're now you're a little slow on it actually getting to gpus yeah I was trying to be nice I know well you know too nice I was trying to be nice you know my gu when I was backstage before I came on here you were talking about like owning your mistakes or something right so you don't have to volunteer it out of the blue I I think this one has been well tried it's like I got breaked over the but as soon as you got into it as soon as you got into it you got into it strong let's just put it there you go there you go now now now the thing that's really cool about about generative AI is is these days when I use WhatsApp I feel like I'm collaborating with what'sapp I love imagine I'm sitting you're typing and it's generating the images as I'm going I go back and I change my words it's generating other images yeah you know and and so the one that that o old Chinese guy uh enjoying a glass of whiskey at sundown with three dogs golden retriever golden doodle and a bernes mountain dog and it generates you know a pretty good looking pict yeah yeah we're we're getting there every month getting better and then now you could actually load my picture in there actually be me yeah that's as of last week yeah yeah super excited about that now imagine me I know I'm spending a lot of time with my daughters imagining them as mermaids and things over the last um over the last week it's been it's been a lot of fun but yeah I mean that's that's the other half of it I mean the a lot of the Gen stuff is going to on the one hand it's I think going to just be this big upgrade for all of the workflows and products that we've had for a long time but on the other hand there's going to be all these completely new things things that can now get created So Meta AI um you know the idea of having you know just an an AI assistant that can help you with different tasks and um in in our world is going to be you know very creatively oriented like you're saying but um but I mean they're very general so I you don't need to just constrain it to that it'll be able to answer any question um over time I think you know when we move from like the Llama 3 class of models to llama 4 and Beyond it's um it's going to I think feel less like a chat box where it's like you you give it a a a prompt and it just responds then you give it a prompt and it responds and it's just like back and forth I think it's going to pretty quickly evolve to you give it an intent and it actually can go away on multiple time frames and I mean it probably should acknowledge that you gave it an intent up front but I mean you know some of the stuff I think will end up you know it'll spin up you know compute jobs that take you know weeks or months or something then just come back to you when like something happens in the world and I think that that's going to be really powerful so I mean today's AI as you as you know is kind of turnbas you say something it says something back to you um but obviously when we think when we're given a mission or we're giving a problem you know we we'll contemplate multiple options or maybe we come up with a you know a tree of options a decision tree and we walk down to the decision tree simulating in our mind you know what are the different outcomes of each decision that we could potentially make and so we we're doing planning and so in the the future AIS will will kind of do the same one of the things that that I was super excited about when you talked about your vision of Creator AI I just think that's that's a home run idea frankly tell everybody about the Creator Ai and AI Studio that's going to enable you to do that yeah so so we actually I mean this is something that we're we're you know we've talked about it a bit but we're rolling it out a lot wider today um you know a lot of our vision is that I don't think that there's just going to be like one AI model right I mean this is something that some of the other companies in the industry they're like you know it's like they're building like one Central agent and and yeah we we'll have the metai assistant that you can use but a lot of our vision is that we want to empower all the people who use our products to basically create agents for themselves whether that's you know all the many many millions of creators that are on the platform or you know hundreds of millions of small businesses um we eventually want to just be able to pull in all your content and very quickly stand up a business agent and um be able to interact with your customers and you know do sales and customer support and all that so the one that we're that we're just starting to roll out more now is um we call it AI studio and it basically is um a set of tools that eventually is going to make it so that every Creator can build sort of an AI version of themselves um as as sort of an an agent or an assistant that that their Community can interact with there's kind of a fundamental issue here where there's there's just not enough hours in the day right it's like if you're if you're a Creator you want to engage more with your community um but you you you're constrained on time and similarly your community wants to engage with you uh but it's tough I mean there's there's just there's a limited time to do that so the next best thing is is allowing people to basically create these artifacts right it's um it's sort of it's an agent but it's you train it to kind of on on your material um to represent you in the way that you want I think it it's it's a very kind of creative Endeavor almost like a like a piece of of art or content that you're putting out there and know it's it's going to be very clear that it's not engaging with the Creator themselves but I think it'll be another interesting way just like how creators put out content on on these um social systems to be able to have agents that do that similarly I think that there's going to be a thing where people basically create their own agents for all different kinds of uses some will be sort of customized utility things that they're trying to get done that they want to kind of fine-tune and and train an agent for some of will be entertainment and some of the things that people create are just funny you know and just kind of silly in different ways or or kind of have a funny attitude about things that um you know we probably couldn't we probably wouldn't build into meta AI as an assistant but but I think people um people are are kind of pretty interested to see um and interact with and then one of the interesting use cases that we're seeing is people kind of using these agents for support um this was one thing that that was a little bit surp surprising to me is one of the top use cases for meta AI already is people basically using it to roleplay difficult social situations that they're going to be in so whether it's a professional situation it's like all right I want to ask my manager like how do I get a promotion or raise or I'm having this fight with my friend or I'm having this difficult situation with my girlfriend like how like how can this conversation go and basically having a like a completely judgment free zone where you can basically roleplay that and see how how how the conversation will go and and get feedback on it um but a lot of people they don't just want to interact with the same kind of you know agent whether it's met AI or chat GPT or whatever it is that everyone else is using they want to kind of create their own thing so that's that's roughly where we're going with AI Studio but it's all part of this bigger I I guess view that we have that there shouldn't just be kind of one big AI that people interact with we we we just think that the world will be better and more if there's a diversity of these different things I just think it's so cool that if you're an artist and you have a style you could take your style all of your body of work you could fine-tune yeah one of your models yeah and now this becomes an AI model that you can come and you could prompt it you could ask me to uh you know create something along the lines of the art style that I have and you might even give me a piece of art as a make a drawing a sketch as an inspiration and I can generate something for you and it's and you come to my come to my uh uh you know come to my bot for that come to my AI for that it could be it could be a uh every single uh every single restaurant every single website will probably in the future have these AIS yeah I mean I I kind of think that in the future just like every business has you know an email address and a website and a social media account or several I think in the future every business is going to have an AI agent that interfaces with their customers and some of these things I think have been pretty hard to do historically like um if you think about any company it's like you probably have customer support is just a separate organization from sales and that's not really how you'd want it to work as CEO it's just that okay they're kind of different skills you're building up these I'm your customer support just a what's up I'm your yeah well apparently I am yeah I mean whenever Mark needs something as CEO I can't tell whether it's chatbot or it's Mark but he it's just my chatbot just asking you um no well I guess that's kind of yeah when you're CEO you have to do all the stuff but but I mean then when you build the abstraction into your organization a lot of times like the you know in general the organizations are separate because they're kind of optimized for different things but I think like the platonic ideal of this would be that it's kind of one thing right as a you know as a customer you don't really care you know you don't want to like have a different route when you're trying to buy something versus if you're having an issue with something that you bought you just want to have a place that you can go and get your questions answered and be able to um engage with the business in different ways and I think that that applies for creators too I think that the the kind of personal consumer side of this is all that engagement with your customers especially if their complaints is going to make your company better yeah totally right the fact that it's all engaging with this AI is going to capture the the uh the institutional knowledge and how to and all of that can go into analytics which improves the AI and so on so forth yeah yeah so the business version of this is um that I think has a little more integration and we're still in in a pretty early Alpha that but the AI Studio making it so people can kind of create their ugc agents and and different things and getting started on this flywheel of having creators create them I'm I'm pretty excited about that and so can I can I use AI Studio to fine-tune with my images my collection of images yeah you're yeah we're going to get there okay and then I could could I give it load it all the things that I've written so that use it use it as my rag yeah yeah yeah basically okay and then every time I come back to it it loads up the it's memory again so it remembers where it left off last time yep and we carry on our conversation as as if nothing ever happened yeah and and and look I mean like any product it'll get better over time the tools for training it will get better it's not just about what you want it to say I mean I think generally creators and businesses have topics that they want to stay away from too right so just getting better at all this stuff um you know I think the platonic version of this is not just text right you you almost want to just be able to and this is sort of an intersection with some of the codec Avatar work that we're doing over time you want to basically be able to have almost like a video chat with with the um with the with the agent and I think we'll get there over time I don't think that this stuff is that far off but the um the flywheel is spinning really quickly so it's it's it's exciting um there is a lot of new stuff to build and I I think even if the progress on the foundation models kind of stopped now which I don't think it will I think we'd have like five years of product Innovation for the industry to basically figure out how to most effective use all the stuff that's gotten built so far but I actually just think the the kind of foundation models and the progress on the fundamental research is accelerating so um so that it's a it's a pretty wild time your vision of it's all it's all um you know you kind of made this happen so why thank you in the last conversation I I thank you yeah you know that you know we're CEOs we're we're delicate flowers we need a lot of back yeah we're we're pretty grizzled at this point I think we're we're the two kind of longest standing Founders in the industry right it's I mean it's true it's true it's true I just and your hair has gotten gray mine has just gotten longer mine's gotten gray yours gotten curly what's up it was always curly that's why I kept it short okay yeah I just if if I known it was going to take so long to succeed you never would have started no I would have dropped out of college just like you get a head start well that's a that's a good difference between our personalities I I think that these things you got a 12 year Head Start that's pretty good that's pretty good you know you're doing pretty well uh I'm gon to I'm going to be able to carry on let me just put it that way yes so so um I the the thing that I love about about um your vision of that everybody can have an AI that every business can have an AI in our company I want every engineer and every software developer to have an AI yeah and um or many AIS uh the thing that's that that I love about your vision is you also believe that everybody and every company should be able to make their own AI so you actually open sourced uh when you open source llama I thought that was great llama 2.1 by the way I I thought llama 2 was probably the biggest event in AI last year and the reason for that I I thought it was the h100 but you know it's a it's a chicken or the egg question that's a chicken or the egg yeah which came first the h100 no well llama 2 was was actually not the h100 yeah it was a100 yeah thank you and so so um uh but but the reason why I said was the biggest event was because when that came out it activated every company every Enterprise and every industry all of a sudden every Healthcare company was building AIS every company was building AI every large company small companies startups was were building AIS it made it possible for every researcher to be able to re-engage AI again because they have a starting point to do something with um and uh and then now uh 3.1 is out and the excitement just so you know uh you know we work together to to uh uh deploy uh 3.1 we're taking it out to the world's Enterprise and the excitement is just off the charts and and I I think it's going to enable all kinds of applications but tell tell me about your your open- Source philosophy where did I come from from and you know you open source pytorch yeah and that it is now the framework by which AI is done and and uh now you've open source llama 3.1 or llama uh there's a whole ecosystem built around it and so I think it's horrific but where did that all come from yeah so there's there's a bunch of history on on a lot of this I mean we've done a lot of Open Source work over time um I think part of it you know just bluntly is you know we got started after some of the other tech companies right in building out stuff like the distributed computing infrastructure and and the data centers and you know because of that by the time that we built that stuff it wasn't a competitive Advantage so we're like all right we might as well make this open and then we'll benefit from the from the ecosystem around that so we we had a bunch of projects like that I think the biggest one was probably open compute where we took our server designs the network designs and eventually the data center designs and published all of that and by having that become somewhat of an industry standard um all the supply chains basically got or organized around it which had this benefit of saving money for everyone so by making it public um and open we basically have saved billions of dollars from doing that work open compute was also what made it possible for NVIDIA hgx is that we design for one data center all a sudden Works in yeah Works in every data center awesome um so so we so that was an awesome experience and then you we've done it with a bunch of our kind of infrastructure tools things like react pie torch um so I'd say by the time that llama came around we were sort of positively predisposed towards doing this um for for AI models specifically I guess there's a few ways that I look at this I mean one is you know it's been really fun building stuff over the last 20 years at the company um one of the things that that has been sort of the most difficult has been kind of having to navigate the fact that we ship our apps through through our competitors mobile platforms so in the one hand the mobile platforms have been this huge Boon to the industry that's been awesome um on the other hand having to deliver your products through your competitors um is challenging right and and I also you know I grew up in a time where you know the first version of Facebook was on the web and that was open and then you know as it transitioned to mobile you know the plus side of that was you know now everyone has a computer in their pocket so that's great the downside is okay we're a lot more restricted in what we can do so when you look at these generation of computing there's this big recency bias where everyone just looks at mobile and thinks okay because the closed ecosystem because Apple basically won and set the the terms of that and like yeah I know that there's more Android phones out there technically but like apple basically has the whole Market um and and and like all the profits and and basically Android is kind of following Apple in terms of the development of it so I think Apple pretty clearly won this generation but it's not always like that right I me if you go back a generation um you Apple was doing their their kind of closed thing um but Microsoft which was you know it's it obviously isn't like this perfectly open company but you know compared to to to Apple with Windows running on all the different oems and different software uh and different different Hardware um was a much more open ecosystem and Windows Windows was the leading ecosystem it it um you know it it basically in the kind of PC generation of things the open ecosystem one and I am kind of hopeful that in the next generation of computing we're going to return to a Zone where the open ecosystem wins and is the leading one again there will always be a closed one and an open one I think that there's reasons to do both there are benefits to both I'm not like a zealot on this I mean we do closed Source stuff and not everything that we that we publish is open um but I think in general for the Computing platforms that the whole industry is building on there's a lot of value for that if the software especially is open so that's really shaped My Philosophy on this and um for both AI with llama and with the work that we're doing in AR and VR where we're basically making the Horizon OS that we're building for mixed reality um an an open operating system in the sense of of kind of what Android or or Windows was and and basically making it so that um like we're going to be able to work with lots of different Hardware companies to make all different kinds of of devices we basically just want to return the ecosystem to that level where that that's going to be the open one and and I I I'm pretty optimistic that the Next Generation the open ones are going to win for for us specifically um you know I just want to make sure that we have access to I mean this is sort of selfish but I mean it's you know after building this company for a while um one of my things for the next 10 or 15 years is like I just want to make sure that we can build the fundamental technology that we're going to be building social experiences on because there have just been too many things that I've tried to build and then have just been told nah you can't really Build That by the platform provider that at some level I'm just like nah that for the next Generation Um like we're going to go build like all all the way down and and make sure that that we there goes our broadcast opportunity yeah no sorry um sorry um like beep yeah you know we're doing okay for like 20 minutes but give me give me talking about closed platforms and I get angry um so um hey look it it is great I think it's a great world where where uh where there are people who are dedicated uh to build the best possible AI however they build it and they make they they offer it to the World um you know as a service and then but if you want to build your own AI you could still also build your own AI so the ability totally to right to use an AI you know there's a lot of stuff I prefer not to make this jacket myself I prefer to have this Jack made for me you know what I'm saying yeah yeah but so the fact that so the fact that leather could be open source is not a useful concept for me but but I I think the the idea that you could you could have great Services incredible Services as well as open Service open ability then then we basically have the entire Spectrum but the the thing that's that that that you did with 3.1 that was really great was you have 405b you have 70b you have 8B you could you could use it for synthetic data generation use the larger models to essentially teach the smaller models and although the larger models will be more General um it it's less brittle uh you could you could still build a smaller model that fits in you know whatever operating domain or operating cost that you would like to have uh you you uh uh met a guard I think llama guard llama guard for Guard railing fantastic um and so now and the way that that you built the model uh it's built in a transparent way it's uh has you dedicated you've got a world class safety team World Class ethics team uh you could build it in such a way that everybody knows it's built properly and so I really love that part of it yeah and I mean just to finish the thought from from before uh before I got I got Sidetrack there for detour um you know I do think there's this alignment where I we're building it because we want the thing to exist and we want to knock it cut off from some closed model right and um but it this isn't just like a piece of software that you can build it's you know you need an ecosystem around it and so it's it's almost like it it kind of almost wouldn't even work that well if we didn't open source it right it's it's not we're not doing this because we're kind of altruistic people um even though I I I think that this is going to be helpful for the ecosystem and we're doing it because we think that this is going to make the thing that we're building the best by by kind of having a robust ecosystem around how many people contributed to pytorch ecosystem yeah totally mountains of engineering yeah right yeah yeah Nvidia alone we probably have a couple of hundred people just dedicated to making P torch better and scalable and you know more performant and so on so forth yeah and it's it's also just when something becomes something of an industry standard other folks do work around it right so like all of the silicon and the systems will end up being optimized to run this thing really well which will benefit everyone but it will also work well with the system that we're building and that's I I think just one example of how this ends up being um just being really effective so yeah I mean I I think that the open source strategy is going to be is going to be a good one as a business strategy I I think people still don't quite get we we love it so much we built an ecosystem around it we built this thing called on this yeah yeah yeah you guys have been awesome on this I mean every time we're shipping something you guys are the first to to release this and and optimize it and make it work and so I mean I I appreciate that but what can what can I say we have good Engineers you know and so and and well you always just jump on the quickly too so well I you know I'm a I'm a senior citizen but I'm agile you know that's what CEOs have to do um and I recognize an important thing I recognize an important thing and and I I think that llama is genuinely important we built this concept to call an AI Factory uh AI Foundry around it uh so that we can help everybody build take you know a lot of people they they they have a desire to um uh uh build Ai and it's very important for them to own the AI because once they put put that into their their flywheel their data flywheel that's how their company's institutional knowledge is encoded and embedded into an an AI so they can't afford to have the AI flywheel the data flywheel that experienced flywheel somewhere else so and and so open source allows them to do that but they they don't really know how to turn this whole thing into an AI and so we created this thing called an AI Foundry we provide the tooling we provide the expertise uh llama uh technology uh we have the ability to help them uh turn this whole thing uh into an AI service and and then when when we're done with that uh they take it they own it we the output of it's what we call a Nim and this Nim this this neurom micro Nvidia inference micros Service uh they just download it they take it and they run it anywhere they like including on Prem and we have a whole ecosystem of Partners uh from oems that can run the NIMS to uh gsis like Accenture that that we've trained and work with to create llama based Nims and and uh and pipelines and and now we're we're off helping Enterprises all over the world do this I mean it's really quite an exciting thing it's really all triggered off of uh the Llama open sourcing yeah I think especially the ability to help people distill their own models from the big model is going to be a really valuable new thing because I I there's this you just like we talked about on the product side how at least I don't think that there's going to be like one major AI agent that everyone talks to it's at the same level I don't think that there's going to NE necessarily be one model that everyone uses we have a chip AI chip design AI we have a software coding Ai and our software coding AI understands uh USD because we code in USD for for Omniverse stuff um uh we have a software AI that understands verog our ver log um we have uh we have software AI that understands our bugs database and knows how to help us triage bugs and sends it to the right engineers and so each one of these AIS are fine-tuned off of llama and and so we find tune them we guardrail them you know if we if we have a if we have a an AI design for for uh for chip design uh we're not interested in asking it about politics you know and religion and things like that so we guardrail it and so so I think I think every company will essentially have for every single function that they have uh they will likely have AIS that are built for that and they need help to do that yeah I mean I think it's one of the big questions is going to be in the future to what extent are people just using the kind of the bigger more sophisticated models versus just training their own models for the uses that they have and at least I would bet that they are going to be just a a just vast proliferation of different models people we use the largest ones and the reason for that is because our Engineers are their times are so valuable and so we get uh right now we're getting 405b uh optimized for performance and as you know 405b doesn't fit in any GPU no matter how big and so that's why the MV link performance perance is so important we have this every one of our gpus connected by this nonblocking switch called MV link switch and um in the hgx for example there are two of those switches and we make it possible for all these all these gpus to work and and um uh run the 405 BS really performant the reason why we do it is because the the engineers times are so valuable to us you know we want to use the best possible model the fact that it's cost effective by a few pennies who cares and so we we we just want to make sure that the best qu quity of result is presented to them yeah well I mean the 405 I think is about half the cost to inference of the GPT 40 model so I mean at that level it's already I mean it's it's pretty good but yeah I mean I think people are doing stuff on devices or want smaller models they're just going to distill it down so that's like a whole different set of services that AI is running and let's let's pretend for a second that we're hiring that AI that AI for chip design is probably $10 an hour MH you're you're using you know and and uh uh um if you're using it constantly and you're sharing that AI across a whole bunch of Engineers so each engineer probably has an AI that's sitting sitting with them that cost you know doesn't cost very much and we pay the engineers a lot of money and so so to us a few dollars an hour uh amplifies the capabilities of somebody that's really valuable yeah yeah I mean you don't need to convince me if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't hired an AI do it right away that's all we're saying and so so um I I let's let's talk about let's talk about um the next the next wave um you know one of the things that I really love about the work that you guys do computer vision um uh one of the models that we use a lot internally uh is segment everything and um uh you know that that we're now train tring AI models on video so that we can understand the world model our use case our use cases for Robotics and and uh industrial industrial uh digitalization and um uh connecting these AI models into Omniverse so that we can we can um uh model and represent the physical world better uh have robots that operate in these Omniverse worlds better uh your your application uh uh the the Rayband metag glass um your vision for for bringing AI into the virtual world uh is really interesting tell us about that yeah well okay a lot to unpack in there um the segment anything model that that you're talking about we're actually presenting I think the next version of that here at at sigraph segment anything two um and it is it now works it's faster it works with um oh here we go um it works in video now as well I think the these are actually cattle from my Ranch in Kawaii um but by the way these are what they're called delicious delicious marks cows um there you go yeah another next time we do so Mark Mark came up to my house and we made Philly cheese steak together next time you're bringing the cow you did I was more of a sue Chef it was really good it was really good that suf comment okay listen and then at the end of the night though you were like hey so you you you ate enough right and I was like I don't know I could eat another one you're like really you know usually when you say something like you were being I was definitely like yeah we're making more we're making more she did you get enough to eat usually your guest says oh yeah that I'm fine make me another cheese steak Jensen so just to let you know how OCD he is so I turn around I'm I'm prepping the the the cheese steak and said Mark cut the tomatoes and so so Mark I handed him a knife yeah I'm I'm a Precision cutter and so he cuts he cuts the uh the tomatoes every single one of them are perfectly to the exact millimeter but the really interesting thing is I was expecting all the tomatoes to be sliced and kind of stacked up kind of like a a deck of cards and uh but when I turned around he said he needed another another plate and the reason for that was because all of the tomatoes he cut none of them touched each other once he separates one slice of tomato from The Other Tomato they shall not touch again yeah look man if you wanted them to touch you needed to tell me that right why I'm just the Sue Chef okay that's why he needs an AI that doesn't judge yeah it's like so this is super cool okay so it's recognizing the cows track it's recognizing tracking the cows yeah yeah so it's um a lot of fun effects will be able to be made with this and because it'll be open a lot of more serious applications across the industry too so I mean scientists use this stuff to you know study um like coral reefs and natural habitats and um and kind of evolution of Landscapes and things like that but I mean it's uh being able to do this in video and having it be zero shot and be able to kind of interact with it and tell it what you want to track is um it's it's it's pretty cool research so for example the reason why we use it uh for example you have a warehouse and it's got a whole bunch of cameras and the warehouse uh AI uh is watching everything that's going on and let's say a uh you know a stack of Boxes Fell uh or somebody spilled water on the ground um or you know what whatever accident is about to happen the AI recognizes it generates the text send it to somebody and you know uh you know help will come along the way and so that's one way of using it uh instead of recording everything if there's an accident and started recording every nanc a video and then going back and re retrieve that moment it just it just records the important stuff because it knows what it's looking at and so so having a vi video understanding model a video language model is really really powerful for all all these these interesting applications now what else what else are you guys going to work on Beyond uh Ray talk talk to me about yeah so there's all the smart glasses right so I think when we think about the next Computing platform you know we kind of break it down into mixed reality the headsets and the smart glasses and the smart glasses I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around that and wearing it because it's you know pretty much everyone who's wearing a pair of glasses today will end up that'll get upgraded to smart glasses and that's like more than a billion people in the world so that's going to be a pretty big thing um the VMR headsets I think some people find it interesting for gaming or different uses some don't yet my view is that they're going to be both in world I think the smart glasses are going to be sort of the mobile phone kind of always on version of the next Computing platform and the mixed reality headsets are going to be more like your workstation or your game console where when you're sitting down for a more immersive session and you want access to more compute I mean look I mean the glasses are just very small form factor um there going to be a lot of constraints on that just like you can't do the same level of computing on a phone came at exactly the time when all of these breakthroughs in generative AI happened yeah so we we basically for smart classes we've been we've been going at the problem from two different directions on the one hand we've been building what we think is sort of the technology that you need for the kind of Ideal holographic AR glasses and we're doing all the custom silicon work all the custom display stack work like all the stuff that you would need to do to make that work and they're glasses right it's not a headset it's not like a VR or Mr headset they look like glasses but um they're still quite a bit far off from the glasses that you're wearing now I mean those are very thin but um but even even the rayb bands that we that we make you couldn't quite fit all the tech that you need to into that yet for kind of full holographic AR though we're getting close and over the next few years I think we'll we'll basically get closer it'll still be pretty expensive but but I think that'll start to be a product um the other angle that we've come at this is let's start with good-look glasses by partnering with the Best glasses maker in the world es luoda they basically make they have all all the big brands that you use um you know with it's rayan or Oakley or Oliver pees or just like a handful of others kind of all L luoda the Nvidia of glasses um I I think that you know it's um I think they would probably like that analogy but um I mean who wouldn't who wouldn't at this point um but I so we've been working with them on on the rayb bands we're on the second generation and the goal there has been okay let's constrain the form factor to just something that looks great great idea and within that let's put in as much technology as we can understanding that we're not going to get to the kind of ideal of what we want to fit into it technically but it'll it'll but at the end it'll be like great looking glasses and we at this point we have we have camera sensors so you can you can take photos and videos you can actually live stream to Instagram you can take video calls on WhatsApp and stream to the other person um you know what you're seeing um you can I mean it has it has a microphone and speaker so I mean the speaker is actually really good it's open ear so you a lot of people find it more comfortable than than earbuds um you can listen to music and it's just like this private experience that's pretty neat people love that you take phone calls on it um but then it just turned out that that sensor package was exactly what you needed to be able to talk to AI too yeah so that was sort of an accident if you'd asked me five years ago were we gonna get holographic AR before AI I would have said yeah probably right I mean it's it just seems like kind of the graphics progression and the display progression on all the virtual and mixed reality stuff and building up the new display stack we were just making continual progress towards that that's right and then this breakthrough happened with llms and it turned out that we have sort of really high quality AI now and getting better at a really fast rate before you have holographic AR so it's sort of this inversion that that I didn't really expect I mean we're we're fortunately well positioned because we were working on all these different products but I think what you're going to end up with is um just a whole series of different potential glasses products at different price points with different levels of technology in them so I kind of think um based on what we're seeing now with the Rayband metas I I would guess that display AI glasses MH at like a $300 price point are going to be a really big product that like tens of millions of people or hundreds of millions of people eventually are going to have um and you're going to have super interactive AI that you're talking to you have visual you have visual language understanding that you just showed you have realtime translation you could talk to me in one language I hear it in another language yeah then the display is obviously going to be great too but it's going to add a little bit of weight to the glasses and it's going to make them more expensive so I think for there will be a lot of people who want the kind of full holographic display but there are also going to be a lot of people for whom um you know they they want something that eventually is going to be like really thin glasses and well for industrial applications and for some work applications we need that we need I think for Consumer stuff too you think so yeah I mean I I think you know it's I was thinking about this a lot during the you know during covid when when everyone kind of went remote for a bit it's like you're spending all this time on Zoom it's like okay this is like it's great that we have this but um but in the future we're like not that many years away from being able to have a virtual meeting where like you know it's like I'm not here physically it's just my hologram and like it just feels like we're there and we're physically present we can work on something and collaborate on something together but I think this is going to be especially important with AI I could live with with a a device that that I'm not wearing all the time oh yeah but I think we're going to get to the point where it actually is I could it'll be I mean there's with within glasses there's like thinner frames and there's thicker frames and there's like all these Styles but um so I don't I think we're we're a while away from having full holographic glasses in the form factor of your glasses but I think having it in a pair of stylish kind of chunkier framed glasses is not that far off these sunglasses are the face size these days I could see that yeah and and you know what that's that's a very helpful style track exactly that's a very helpful whoever you know it's like like I'm I'm trying to you know TR make my way into becoming like a style influencer so I can like influence this before um you know before the glasses come to the market but you know well I can see you attempting it how's your style influencing working out for you you know it's early yeah it's um it's early it's early um but I don't know I feel like if if if a big part of the future of the business is going to be building um kind of stylish glasses that people wear um this is something I should probably start paying a little more attention to right then we're going to have to retire the version of me that we're the same thing every day but I mean that's the thing about glasses too I I think it's um you know it's unlike you know even the watch or or phones like people really do not want to all look the same right and and it's like so I do think that it's you know it's it's a it's a platform that I think is going to lend itself going back to the theme that we talked about before towards being an open ecosystem because I think the diversity of form factors that people and styles that people are going to demand is going to be immense um it's not like everyone is not going to want to put like the one kind of pair of glasses that you know whoever else designs like that's not I don't think that's going to fly for this yeah I think that's right well Mark it's sort of incredible that we're living through a time where where the entire Computing stack is re being reinvented how we think about software you know what what Andre calls software one and software 2 and now we're basically in software 3 now the way we compute um from general purpose Computing to these generative neural network processing way of doing Computing um the capabilities the applications we could develop now are Unthinkable in the past and and this technology generative AI uh I don't remember another technology that that in such a fast rate influenced consumers Enterprise Industries and science yeah and to be able to to cut across cut across um all these different fields of science from from climate Tech to U biotech um uh to uh physical sciences uh in every single field that we're encountered uh generative AI is is right at the middle of that uh fundamental transition and and it's and and in addition to that uh the things that you're talking about generative AI is going to make a a profound impact in society you know the products that we're making and one of the things that I'm s super excited about and somebody asked me earlier is there going to be a you know gents and AI um well that's exactly the creative AI you were talking about you know where we just build our own AIS and I I load it up with all of the things that I've written and and I I fine-tune it with with uh uh with the way I answer questions and and uh and hopefully hopefully over time the accumulation of use and you know becomes a really really great assistant and companion for for uh uh for a whole lot of people who just wants to you know ask questions or um bounce ideas off of and and it'll be the version of Jensen that as as you were saying earlier that's that's not judgmental you're not afraid of being judged and so you could come and interact with it all the time but but I I just think I think that th those are real really incredible things and and you know we we write we write a lot of things all the time and and how incredible is it just to give it you know three or four topics these are the basic themes of what I want to write about and write it in my voice and just use that as a starting point so there's there's just so many things that we can do now uh it it's really terrific working with you and uh uh I I know that I know that uh it's not easy building a company and you pivoted yours from desktop to mobile to VR to AI all these devices uh it's really really really extraordinary to watch and Nvidia pivoted many times ourselves and I know exactly how hard it is doing that and uh um you know both of us have have gotone kicked in our teeth a lot plenty over the years but that's that's what it takes to to uh uh to want to be a Pioneer and and innovate so it's really great watching you well and likewise I mean it's like it's I'm not sure if it's a pivot if you keep doing the thing you were doing before but but is as well but it's but you add to it I mean there's more chapters to all the to to all this and I think the same thing for it's been fun watching I me the journey that you guys have been on I mean just and you went we went through this period where everyone was like nah everything is going to kind of move to these devices and you know just going to get super kind of cheap compute and and you guys just kept on plugging away at this and it's like no like actually you're going to want these big systems that can that can paralyze we went the other way yeah no and it's I mean yeah we went and instead of building smaller and smaller devices we make computers as size unfashionable for a while a little unfashionable super unfashionable yeah yeah but now now it's cool and and instead of in you know we started building a graphics chip a GPU and and now when you when uh when you're deploying a GPU you still call it Hopper h100 but so you guys know when when when Zuck calls it h100 his data center of h100s there's like I think you're coming up on 600,000 and and they're we're good customers that's how you get the Jensen Q&A at sigraph wow hang on that I was getting the Mark Zuckerberg Q&A you were my guest and I wanted to make sure that that you just called me one day and you're like hey yeah you know in like a couple of weeks we're doing this thing at sigar I'm like yeah I don't think I'm doing anything that day to Denver it sounds fun exactly I'm not doing anything that afternoon you showed up and and uh but but the thing the thing is just incredible these these systems that you guys build uh they're they giant systems incredibly hard to orchestrate incredibly hard to to run and you know you said that that you got into the GPU uh Journey later than than most but you're operating larger than just about anybody and it's it's incredible to watch and congratulations on everything that you've done and uh you you are quite the style icon now check check out this guy huh early stage working on it working on it it's a ladies and gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg thank you hang on hang on well um you know you know um so turns out the last time that we got together after dinner Mark Mark and I I where Jersey swap Jersey Swap and and uh we took a picture and and turned in it turned into something viral and um and now I thought that he he has no trouble wearing my jacket I don't know is that my look I don't think I can should be it should be is that right yeah I actually I um I made one for you you did you did yeah that one's marks I mean hey let's see we got we got a box back here it's black and leather and sheering oh I didn't make this I just ordered it online hang on a second hang on a second it's a little chilly in here I think I'll try this on I think this is my goodness I mean this is that's a it's a Vibe you just need is this me we'll be pretty I mean get this guy a chain all right next time I see you I'm bring you a gold chain so fair is fair so I let you know I I was telling everybody that Lori bought me a new jacket to celebrate this year's sigraph sigraph is is a big thing in our company as you could imagine RTX was launched here amazing things were launched here and this is a brand new jacket it's literally 2 hours old wow and so I think we had a jersey swap again all right well this one's yours I mean this is worth more cuz it's used let's see I don't know I don't I think I think Mark is pretty buff he's the guy's pretty jacked I mean you too man all right all right everybody gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg have a great Sig oh\n'''","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-16T13:23:58.085176Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-16T13:23:58.085778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-16T13:23:58.368996Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-16T13:23:58.085738Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-16T13:23:58.367320Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"all_info
